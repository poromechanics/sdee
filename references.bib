@article{Tamma2011,
	Abstract = {An overview of recent advances in computational dynamics for modeling and simulation is described. The targeted objectives are towards a wide variety of science and engineering applications in particle and continuum dynamics of structures and materials which fall in this class. Starting with the supposition that in the beginning, the well known Newton's law of motion for N-body systems is given, and is a statement of the principle of balance of linear momentum, subsequently, using this as a landmark, firstly, the principal relations to various other distinctly different fundamental principles which are of primary interest here are established. Likewise, for continuum dynamics of structures, via the principle of balance of linear momentum, analogous developments are also established. Consequently, these distinctly different fundamental principles are shown to serve as the starting point for the various developments. Stemming from three distinctly different fundamental principles, we present recent advances in N-body dynamical systems, and also continuous-body dynamical systems with focus on numerical aspects in space/time discretization. The fundamental principles are the following: the Principle of Virtual Work in Dynamics, Hamilton's Principle and as an alternate (due to inconsistencies associated with Hamilton's principle), Hamilton's Law of Varying Action, and the Principle of Balance of Mechanical Energy. Both vector and scalar formalisms are described in detail with particular focus towards general numerical discretizations in space and/or time for N-body and continuum-elastodynamics applications which are encountered in a wide class of holonomic-scleronomic problems. The formulations include the classical Newtonian mechanics framework with vector formalism, and new scalar formalisms with descriptive functions such as the Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian, and the Total Mechanical Energy to readily enable numerical discretizations. The concepts emanating from the present developments and distinctly different fundamental principles inherently: (1) can independently be shown to yield the strong form of the governing mathematical model equations of motion that are continuous in space and/or time together with the natural boundary conditions; the various frameworks for the case of holonomic-scleronomic systems with the mentioned limitations are indeed all equivalent, (2) can explain naturally how the weak statement of the Bubnov-Galerkin weighted-residual form that is customarily employed for discretization with vector formalism arises for both space and time, and (3) can circumvent relying upon traditional practices of conducting numerical discretizations starting either from balance of linear momentum (Newton's second law) involving Cauchy's equations of motion (governing equations) arising from continuum mechanics or via (1) and (2) above if one chooses this option. The concepts instead provide new avenues for numerical space/time discretization for continuum-dynamical systems or time discretization for N-body systems, and consequently, they enable equivalences to be drawn from amongst the various frameworks under certain restrictions to provide a unified approach and viewpoint. In addition, for the time discretization, focusing attention upon the class of Linear Multi Step (LMS) methods which are the most popular in research and commercial software, we particularly describe from a unified viewpoint, new avenues of discretization of the equations of motion via a new Total Energy framework. The resulting developments lead to improved physical insight, inherit computationally attractive features for developing algorithms by design, and new and optimal algorithm designs, while recovering most of the developments that currently exist from traditional and/or classical practices.},

@article{Mello1990,
	Abstract = {Weak formulations in Analytical Dynamics are developed, paralleling the variational methods in elastostatics, and including a fundamental yet novel approach for treating constraints (both holonomic and nonholonomic). A general three-field approach is presented, in which the momentum balance conditions, the compatibility conditions between displacement and velocity, the constitutive relations and the displacement and momentum boundary conditions are all enforced in weak form. A primal, or kinematic formulation is developed from the general form by enforcing the compatibility conditions and displacement boundary conditions a priori. The conditional stability of the kinematic formulation is the counterpart of the locking phenomenon in elastostatics and may be avoided, either by reduced order integration, or by utilizing a mixed formulation. Toward this end, a two-field mixed formulation is presented, which follows from the general form, when the constitutive relations are satisfieda priori. A general set of the constraint equations is introduced into the kinematic and mixed formulations, using a specific choice of multipliers, which results in modified variational principles. Several simple examples concerning rigid body dynamics are presented.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents general variational formulations for dynamical problems, which are easily implemented numerically. The development presents the relationship between the very general weak formulation arising from linear and angular momentum balance considerations, and well known variational priciples. Two and three field mixed forms are developed from the general weak form. The variational principles governing large rotational motions are linearized and implemented in a time finite element framework, with appropriate expressions for the relevant ``tangent'' operators being derived. In order to demonstrate the validity of the various formulations, the special case of free rigid body motion is considered. The primal formulation is shown to have unstable numerical behavior, while the mixed formulation exhibits physically stable behavior. The formulations presented in this paper form the basis for continuing investigations into constrained dynamical systems and multi-rigid-body systems, which will be reported in subsequent papers.},

	Abstract = {The finite element technique is applied to functional which govern dynamical problems, where time is an independent variable. The present paper demonstrates improved accuracy in mass-spring-damper systems and exemplifies ``rendevous problems'' of a ``travelling'' particle in a medium. The motion is governed by Hamilton's principle. The time interval is fixed. Functionals are constructed from Hamilton's extended principle and appropriate conditions stating the various constraints. Initial value problems may be incorporated by writing a functional in accordance with Gurtin's method. Shape functions are polynomials in time and can be extended to other spatial variables when present. As a result of a variation to the functional, a system of algebraic (not necessarily linear) equations is formed. This system is solved simultaneously to yield its motion within the boundaries of the given time interval.},

	Abstract = {The Galerkin Formulation and the Hamilton-Ritz Formulation: A Comparison. It is the purpose of this paper to show why the solutions to continuous systems, whether conservative or nonconservative, stationary or nonstationary, cannot be achieved from the Galerkin formulation by means of the simple power series with the simplicity now demonstrated in our published papers. Hamilton's law and Hamilton's principle are discussed. The Galerkin formulation is applied to the differential equation. The source of the differential equation is immaterial. The result is compared to the Ritz method applied to Hamilton's law which is called the Hamilton-Ritz formulation. The result clearly demonstrates why our direct analytical solutions for continuua, except for easily identifiable special cases, have not been and cannot be obtained through a correct, direct application of the Galerkin method.},

	Abstract = {Hamilton's principle and Hamilton's law are discussed. Hamilton's law is then applied to achieve direct solutions to time-dependent, nonconservative, initial value problems without the use of the theory of differential or integral equations. A major question has always plagued competent investigators who use ``energy methods,'' viz., ``Why is it that one can derive the differential equations for a system from Hamilton's principle and then solve these equations (at least in principle) subject to applicable initial and boundary conditions; but one cannot obtain a solution directly from Hamilton's principle except in very special cases?'' This paper provides the answer to that question. In Hamilton's own words, ``... the peculiar combination it [i.e., Hamilton's law] involves, of the principles of variations with those of partial differentials, for the determination and use of an important class of integrals, may constitute, when it shall be matured by the future labors of mathematicians, a separate branch of analysis.''},

Hamilton's principle is used as a suitable variational statement which means that the time is discretised into a set of finite elements which are taken to be the same for all structural elements. The method is introduced for the unidimensional case and thereafter generalised for multidegree of freedom systems. The use of arbitrary time elements is outlined. The method appears particularly suitable for the investigation of time dependent dynamic phenomena without prior deduction of the natural modes and frequencies. Linear as well as nonlinear phenomena may be analysed.},

These techniques, the extended-paraxial boundary, the standard-viscous boundary, and the unified-viscous boundary, are all designed to absorb infinitely radiating waves in a finite, computational grid. All three methods, in practice, produce results that are fairly equal. In theory, the extended-paraxial boundary appears to possess a significant advantage in accuracy, but it demonstrated only slightly greater accuracy in the numerical comparisons.},

	Abstract = {In practical calculations, it is often essential to introduce artificial boundaries to limit the area of computation. Here we develop a systematic method for obtaining a hierarchy of local boundary conditions at these artificial boudaries. These boundary conditions not only guarantee stable difference approximations but also minimize the (unphysical) artificial reflections which occur at the boundaries.},
