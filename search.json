    "text": "Mathematical (analytical or numerical) modeling of continuum mechanics problems is an integral part of engineering design, scientific research, and technological inventions. For example, in the field of geotechnical engineering, numerical methods are indispensable tool for designing and health monitoring of ground and soil-structures, such as embankments, bridges and pile foundations, and tunnels subjected to static and dynamic loading conditions. In recent years, techniques have been developed for handling the issues related to the erosion of soil structures, piping flows within natural slopes, and the stability of embankments subjected to tidal waves. Further, environmental impact and safety assessments of the ground vibrations generated by high-speed trains (Ditzel, Herman, and HÖLSCHER 2001; Krylov 1996; Takemiya 2003) and road traffic (Chua, Balendra, and Lo 1992; Clemente and Rinaldis 1998; Clouteau, Degrande, and Lombaert 2001; Maeda et al. 1998) close to the residential areas, hospitals, and high-tech industries are of paramount importance.\nThe finite element method is one of the most popular numerical methods for computing accurate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe many engineering problems. The FEM originated from the structural mechanics discipline and has since been extended to other areas of solid mechanics as well as heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetism. In dealing with PDEs, it is useful to differentiate between several types; elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic PDEs. For example, elliptic PDEs generally represent static problems in which only boundary conditions (viz., Dirichlet boundary condition and/or Neumann boundary condition) need to be prescribed. Hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, on the other hand, represent a transient problem and require specification of both intial and boundary conditions. Clearly, both the theoretical and numerical treatment differ considerably for these three types of PDEs.\nThe most extending approach for solving a transient problem is based on a classical semi-discretized FEM formulation. In this approach, usually a generalized Galekin methods are first employed to construct the weak-form of governing PDEs. Such weak-forms are constructed in the spatial domain while assuming that the shape functions are independent of time. Furthermore, spatial nodal values of the trial functions only depend upon the time while nodal values of the test functions remain independent of the time. The time-independece of the shape functions and time-dependence of nodal values of the solution create an uncoupled space-time domain. Consequently, one obtains a system of ordinary differential equations in time. Time-marching schemes based on the finite difference methods are then used to solve the resultant system of ODEs. In this way, the semi-discrete FEM treats the problem differently in the space and time domain; variation principles are used for the former domain, and finite difference techniques are used for latter domain. Further, it is well established that the finite differnce methods produce less accurate solutions than FEM. Therefore,careful selection of a finite difference scheme is required to achieve the desired level of accuracy. Here, let us mentioned that a poor selection of FDM may limit the overall accuracy of the semi-discrete FEM, or in some cases may even produce inconsistent results. Lastly, selection of the appropriate FDM mainly depend upon the type of problem, for example, the algorithms which works well for the heat-diffusion problem may not be suitable for the problem of elastodynamics.\nIn transient problems, one wishes to use a high-order accurate time integration scheme with a large time-step size in an attempt to reduce the computation cost. However, the use of large time-step size is only possible if the time-marching scheme is unconditionally stable; the stability of the time integration algorithm does not depend upon the time-step size. Unconditionally stable methods, such as the Newmark-beta method (Newmark 1959), the HHT–\\(\\alpha\\) method (Hilber, Hughes, and Taylor 1977), the Houbolt method (Houbolt 1950), and the Wilson–\\(\\theta\\) method (Bathe and Wilson 1976), are the most often used dynamic solvers in semi-discrete FEM. However, these methods are only second-order accurate. Furthermore, Dahlquist’s theorem says that a single-step unconditionally stable time-integration algorithm can be at most second-order accurate (Dahlquist 1963). High-order accurate time-integration schemes based on the finite difference schemes can be employed. However, these schemes are generally conditionally stable and require very small time steps for stability (Hughes 1983). The requirement of small time steps increases the overall computational cost of large-scale simulations. Therefore, there is still a need for dynamic solvers which are high-order accurate and unconditionally stable, such that large time steps can be used to reduce the computational cost while maintaining the accuracy of the solutions.\nAt present, time-discontinuous Galerkin approach have been well studied for the problems involving first order time derivatives. In the field of computational fluid dynamics, this approach have been used for problems involving the moving and free boundaries (Bazilevs, Takizawa, and Tezduyar 2013). In TDG/ST/FEM, shape-functions are usually defined on the space-time domain. The weak form of the govering equations are formulated in a space-time slab, therefore, no additional time-marching schemes are required. Therefore, such method may provide a unified framework for using the Lagrangian mesh, Eulerian mesh, and arbitrary moving mesh. In addition, for problems involving the second-order time derivatives TDG/ST/FEM facilitates the weak-enforcement of initial conditions through jump-discontinuity in time. In this way, TDG/ST/FEM provides a general framework for arbitrary high order accurate, unconditionally stable time integration algorithms. We believe that these characteristics of TDG/ST/FEM may have great potential for solving the problems of large-deformation dynamic problems.\nThe objective of this thesis is to develope an efficient space-time finite element method within time-discontinuous Galerkin framework. In this context, a velocity-based single-field ST/FEM is developed. Hereafter, the term v-ST/FEM will be used to denote the proposed method. In v-ST/FEM, velocity is the primary unknowns which is discontinuous in time and continuous in space. The displacement field is obtained by time integration of the velocity field in a post-processing step. The main advantage of v-ST/FEM is that it involves less number of unknowns–unlike other ST/FEM–which makes v-ST/FEM applicable to the large-scale practical problems at relatively low computation cost. In addition, the proposed scheme naturally allows the coupling of space-time domain, consequently, it can be used with Lagrangian mesh, Eulerian mesh, or arbitrary moving mesh framework. We believe that the proposed method can be developed further as an effective tool for simulating problems with moving and free boundaries.\nThis thesis includes the following chapters:\nIn Chapter [ch:ch3], the working principles of the time-discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (TDG/FEM) are described by using a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a second order ODE. Subsequently, a velocity-based time-discontinuous space-time finite element method (v-ST/FEM) for a multidimensional elastodynamics problem is developed. Several numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the efficiency and the applicability of the v-ST/FEM.\nIn Chapter [ch:ch4], a concise presentation regarding the theory of wave propagation in an elastic solid is given. After briefly discussing the reflection and refraction of a plane harmonic waves it is shown that the problem of dynamic soil-structure interaction (SSI) can be viewed as a wave-scattering phenomenon, in which the free-field response of an elastic half-space is perturbed by the existing structure. The chapter presents some of the most popular boundary conditions for solving wave propagation problems in the unbounded domain. In addition, the viscous boundary conditions and modified viscous boundary conditions are derived.\nIn Chapter [ch:ch5], v-ST/FEM method is used to solve the problem of dynamic soil-structure interaction. In this context, finite element modeling of the unbounded soil domain is performed by placing modified viscous boundaries at some distance from the existing structure. A dynamic dam-soil interaction problem is considered to validate the formulation and computer implementation of v-ST/FEM. The results obtained by proposed scheme are validated by solving the same problem using the semi-discrete FEM with classical Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method. Results obtained by two methods are compared and found to be nearly identical.\nIn Chapter [ch:ch6], v-ST/FEM is used to compute the seismic response of the dam-reservoir (DR) and dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system while considering all types of dynamic interaction. Both dam and the underlying soil domain is assumed to be linearly elastic, and material damping is modeled by Rayleigh damping. The water in the reservoir is assumed to be inviscid, linearly compressible with a small amplitudes for the displacements and velocity. Thus, the hydrodynamic pressure in the reservoir is given by the pressure wave equation. In the finite element modeling, viscous boundary conditions are used to truncate the semi-infinite domain of reservoir and underlying soil-domain.\nIn Chapter [ch:ch7], v-ST/FEM is employed for the problems involving dynamic response of solids and structures with nonlinear stress-strain relationships. The problem of dynamic interaction between the concrete gravity dam and reservoir is taken as a model problem, in which a generalized nonlinear stress-strain relationship is used to describe the material behavior of concrete in the dam. The foundation underneath the dam-reservoir (DR) system is assumed to be perfectly rigid. The governing equations describing the dynamic interaction between dam and reservoir constitute a system of linear-nonlinear coupled equations, in which linear equations govern the reservoir domain and nonlinear equations govern the solid domain. A block-iterative scheme is used to enforce the coupling between the solid and fluid domain. In each iteration of v-ST/FEM with the block-iterative scheme, the linearized equations of the solid domain are first solved to compute the increments in the velocity field. Subsequently, the total velocities are corrected and then used for computing the trial values of hydrodynamic pressures in the reservoir by solving the linear equation for the reservoir domain. In each iteration of the proposed scheme, therefore, linear equations for the solid and fluid domain are solved, separately, which significantly decreases the computation cost.\n\n\n\n\nBathe, Klaus-Jürgen, and Edward L Wilson. 1976.

    "text": "2.1 Weak forms for the TDG/FEM\nTo understand the working principle of the time-discontinuous Galerkin finite element method (TDG/FEM) consider the following initial value problem [^1] described by a first order ordinary differential equation equation (ODE).\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n    \\frac{{du}}{{dt}} + \\lambda u - f\\left( t \\right)&=0 \\quad t \\in \\left[ {0,T} \\right],\\\\\n    u(0)&=u_0\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the total time, \\(u:=u(t)\\) is the primary unknown, \\(f(t)\\) represents the excitation function, and \\(u_0\\) is the initial condition. The analytical solution to this problems takes the form of\n\\[\nu\\left( t \\right) = {u_0}{e^{-\\lambda t}} + \\int_0^t {{e^{-\\lambda \\left( {t - \\tau } \\right)}}f\\left( \\tau  \\right)d\\tau }\n\\]\nLet us now consider a non-uniform subdivision for the time domain \\(\\left[ {0,T} \\right]\\),\n\\[0 = {t_0} &lt; {t_1} &lt;  \\cdots  &lt; {t_N} = T,\\]\nwith\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  I_n &= (t_n,t_n+1), & \\Delta t_n &= t_{n+1}-t_{n}, &\n  \\Delta t = \\mathop {\\max }\\limits_{\\left( {0 \\leqslant n \\leqslant N - 1} \\right)} \\left( {\\Delta {t_n}} \\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn the finite element method (FEM), the time interval, \\(I_n\\), denotes the interior of the one-dimensional time finite element, and \\(\\partial {I_n} = \\left\\{ {{t_n},{t_{n + 1}}} \\right\\}\\) denotes the boundary of \\(I_n\\) [^2]. Accordingly, the finite element discretization of the continuous time domain can be written as (see also Figure 2.1),\n\\[\n{I_h}: = \\bigcup\\limits_{n = 0}^{N - 1} {\\left( {{I_n} \\cup \\partial {I_n}} \\right)}\n\\]\nIn TDG/FEM, the solutions to the problem, \\(u^h(t)\\), are considered to be discontinuous at the boundary of the time-domain. The solutions, however, remain continuous inside the time-finite element \\(I_n\\), and approximated by piecewise polynomials (e.g., Lagrange polynomials).\nTherefore, the discontinuity in \\(u^h(t)\\) occurs at times that belong to the finite set \\(\\left\\{ {{t_0},{t_1}, \\cdots ,{t_N}} \\right\\}\\). The jump discontinuity in time for \\(u^h\\) is given by\n\\[\n{\\left[\\kern-0.15em\\left[ {{u^h}}\n\\right]\\kern-0.15em\\right]_n} = u_n^ +  - u_{n}^{-}\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n        u_n^ +  &= \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{\\varepsilon  \\to 0} {u^h}\\left( {t + \\varepsilon } \\right), &\n        u_n^ -  &= \\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{\\varepsilon  \\to 0} {u^h}\\left( {t - \\varepsilon } \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nare the discontinuous values of \\(u^h\\) at time \\(t=t_n\\). Figure 2.2 illustrates the concept of time discontinuity.\nLet \\(C^0(\\star)\\) denote the space of piecewise continuous functions defined on domain \\((\\star)\\). In addition, consider \\({\\wp_{l}}\\left( {{I_n}} \\right)\\), the collection of all polynomials defined on \\(I_n\\) with a total degree of no more than \\(l\\). Accordingly, the functional space required for the TDG/FEM is given by,\n\\[\n\\Im_{l}^{h}: = \\left\\{ {\\left. {{u^h}} \\right|{u^h} \\in {C^0}\\left( {\\bigcup\\limits_{n = 0}^{N - 1} {{I_n}} } \\right),{{\\left. {{u^h}} \\right|}_{{I_n}}} \\in {\\wp_l}\\left( {{I_n}} \\right)} \\right\\}\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nwhere, \\({{u^h}}\\), denotes the global solutions which can be discontinuous at time steps given by the end points of the interval \\(I_n\\), and \\({{{\\left. {{u^h}} \\right|}_{{I_n}}}}\\) denotes the restriction of \\(u_h\\) to \\(I_n\\).\nFor any \\(\\delta u^h, u^h \\in \\Im _l^h\\) consider the following variational form corresponding to Equation 2.1,\n\\[\n\\delta \\Pi_n := \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta u^h\\left( {\\frac{{du^h}}{{dt}} + \\lambda u^h - f\\left( t \\right)} \\right)dt}\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nor\n\\[\n\\delta \\Pi_n = \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta u^h\\frac{{du^h}}{{dt}}dt}  + \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta u^h\\left[ {\\lambda u^h - f\\left( t \\right)} \\right]dt}\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nHere, once again note that the domain of integration is \\(I_n\\), and \\(u^h\\) is discontinuous at times \\(t_n\\) and \\(t_{n+1}\\).\nUse of the integration by parts for the first term in Equation 2.6 will will result in the following variation form for the TDG/FEM,\n\\[\n\\delta \\Pi_n =- \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {u^h\\frac{{d\\delta u^h}}{{dt}}dt}  + \\left[ {\\delta u^h \\cdot {u^*}} \\right]_{{t_n}}^{{t_{n + 1}}} + \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta u^h\\left[ {\\lambda u^h - f\\left( t \\right)} \\right]dt}\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\nwhere, \\(u^*\\) denotes the unique value of \\(u^h\\) to be used at the end-points of the interval \\(I_n\\) and obtained by computing the information from the neighboring time intervals. A detailed definition concerning its concrete value will be soon introduced in the following text.\nSubsequent use of the integration by parts for the first term in Equation 2.7 will yield another variation form for the TDG/FEM. This variation form is described below.\n\\[\n\\delta \\Pi_n = \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta u^h\\frac{{du^h}}{{dt}}dt}  + \\left[ {\\delta u^h\\left( {{u^*} - u^h} \\right)} \\right]_{{t_n}}^{{t_{n + 1}}} + \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta u^h\\left[ {\\lambda u^h - f\\left( t \\right)} \\right]dt}\n\\tag{2.8}\\]\nMathematically, the formulations given in Equation 2.7 and Equation 2.8 are the TDG/FEM schemes for Eq. Equation 2.1 in weak and strong form, respectively. In Equation 2.7 due to the presence of first order time derivative of the test function \\(\\delta u^h\\), the test function should be continuous in time. In Equation 2.8, however, the continuity of the test functions is not required since this form does not include the time derivative of \\(\\delta u^h\\).\nIn Equation 2.7, recall that the solution \\((u^h)\\) is not well defined at the \\(\\partial I_n =\\left\\{ {{t_n},{t_{n + 1}}} \\right \\}\\) as it takes two values at each end-points of \\(I_n\\). Hence, a unique representative value \\(u^*\\) has been adopted in the TDG formulation which should be specified only at time \\(\\partial I_n\\). The value of \\(u^*\\) at time \\(t_n\\) can be computed by using \\(u_n^+\\) and \\(u_n^-\\) (see the footnote). [^3] The most widely used definition for \\(u^*\\) is based on the upwind flux treatment in time (Eriksson, Johnson, and Thomée 1985; Chen, Steeb, and Diebels 2006; Cockburn 2003; Hesthaven and Warburton 2007) and given by,\n\\[\nu^{*}:=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc}\nu_{0} & \\text{if}\\quad n=0\\\\\nu_{n}^{-} & otherwise\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\tag{2.9}\\]\nThe choice of such a definition is inspired by the fact that in a transient problem the solutions at time \\(t_n\\) should be equal to the value of its immediate past \\(t_n-\\varepsilon\\). Therefore, it is natural to start the numerical procedure at \\(t=t_0\\) with the prescribed initial condition \\(u^*=u_0\\), and transport this idea to the subsequent time-slabs.\nIncorporating the definition of \\(u^*\\) in Equation 2.8, the TDG/FEM weak,\n\\[\n\\delta {\\Pi _n} = \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta {u^h}\\frac{{d{u^h}}}{{dt}}dt}  + \\delta {u^h}\\left( {{t_n}} \\right){\\left[\\kern-0.15em\\left[ {{u^h}}\n\\right]\\kern-0.15em\\right]_n} + \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta {u^h}\\left[ {\\lambda {u^h} - f\\left( t \\right)} \\right]dt}\n\\tag{2.10}\\]\nLet us now focus on the TDG/FEM weak form for the initial value problem (see Eq. Equation 2.1). By multiplying the residual of Eq. Equation 2.1 with the test function \\(\\delta u^h\\) and then integrating in the time domain \\(\\left[ {0,T} \\right]\\) following weak form can be obtained.\n\\[\n\\delta \\Pi : = \\int_I^{} {\\delta u\\left[ {\\frac{{du}}{{dt}} + \\lambda u - f\\left( t \\right)} \\right]dt}  = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{N - 1} {\\delta {\\Pi _n}}  = 0\n\\tag{2.11}\\]\nDue to the weakly prescribed initial condition, the weak form given above transforms into a local weak form defined on each time slab \\(I_n\\).\n\\[\n\\delta {\\Pi _n} = \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta {u^h}\\frac{{d{u^h}}}{{dt}}dt}  + \\delta  {u^h}\\left( {{t_n}} \\right){\\left[\\kern-0.15em\\left[ {{u^h}}\n\\right]\\kern-0.15em\\right]_n} + \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta {u^h}\\lambda {u^h}dt}  - \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta {u^h}f\\left( t \\right)dt}  = 0\n\\tag{2.12}\\]\nRearranging the terms in Equation 2.12 and using the expression for the jump discontinuity in time (see Eq. Equation 2.2),\n\\[\n\\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta {u^h}\\frac{{d{u^h}}}{{dt}}dt}  + \\delta {u_n}u_n^ +  + \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta {u^h}\\lambda {u^h}dt}  = \\delta {u_n}u_n^ -  + \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {\\delta {u^h}f\\left( t \\right)dt}\n\\tag{2.13}\\]\nin which the first term on right hand side depicts the initial condition for each time-slabs \\(I_n\\). Here note that the information about \\(u_n^-\\) is already obtained from the computation in the previous time slab \\(I_{n-1}\\). Further, in the beginning of the process (i.e., \\(n=0\\)) the initial condition is incorporated in the computation according to the definition in Equation 2.9. In this way, initial boundary condition becomes the part of the solution and need not to be specified in explicit terms.",

The governing equation of motion is described by the following second order initial value problem in time.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\\frac{{{d^{2}}u}}{{d{t^{2}}}}+2\\zeta{\\omega_{n}}\\frac{{du}}{{dt}}+\\omega_{n}^{2}u & =f\\left(t\\right)\\quad\\forall t\\in\\left[0,T\\right]\\\\\nu(0) & =u_{0}\\\\\n\\frac{du(0)}{dt} & =v_{0}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nwhere \\(u:=u(t)\\) is the unknown displacement, \\(f(t)\\) is the external force acting on the system. Further, \\(u_{0}\\) and \\(v_{0}\\) are the prescribed initial values of the displacement and velocity, respectively. Damping ratio \\(\\zeta\\) and the natural frequency of vibration \\(\\omega_{n}\\) of the system are related to the mass \\(m\\), stiffness of the spring \\(k\\), and damping coefficient \\(c\\) by:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega_{n} & =\\sqrt{k/m}, & \\zeta & =\\frac{c}{2m\\omega_{n}}=\\frac{c}{2\\sqrt{mk}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nFurther, the TDG/FEM for solving the second order ODE can be arranged into two categories; the displacement-velocity based two-field TDG/FEM, and the single-field TDG/FEM. These strategies are discussed in the following sections.\nIn the two-field TDG/FEM, both the displacement (\\(u\\)) and the velocity (\\(v\\)) are independently interpolated using the piecewise polynomials. [^7] The interpolation is performed such that within a time-slab \\(I_{n}\\) the solutions remain continuous, and at the end-points (i.e., \\(t_{n}\\) and \\(t_{n+1}\\)) the solutions are discontinuous. Accordingly, the set \\(\\left\\{ t_{1},t_{2},\\cdots,t_{N}\\right\\}\\) denotes the locations in time where discontinuity in solutions occur. Thus, the displacement and velocity are the primary unknowns in the uv-TDG/FEM.\nTherefore, the critical step in solving the second order initial value problem using the uv-TDG/FEM involves recasting of Equation 3.1 into a system of two first-order ODEs. The new system is then described by\n\\[\n\\frac{{dv}}{{dt}}+2\\zeta{\\omega_{n}}v+\\omega_{n}^{2}u=f\\left(t\\right)\\quad\\forall t\\in[0,T]\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{{du}}{{dt}}-v=0\\quad\\forall t\\in[0,T]\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\n\\[\nu(0)={u_{0}},\\quad v(0)={v_{0}}\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nEquation 3.3 and Equation 3.4 represent the first order ODE, and the first order ODE, and the TDG/FEM described in the previous section can be employed directly. However, note that these two equations cannot be solved independently due to the coupling between displacement and velocity.\nFollowing the same procedure as described in the previous section, the weak-form of the uv-TDG/FEM can be stated as:\nA careful examination of uv-TDG/FEM weak-form leads to the following remarks.\nLet us now focus on the discretization of the two-field TDG weak-form.

    "text": "3.3 Velocity based single-field TDG/FEM\nFrom the displacement based single-field TDG/FEM it follows that the number of unknowns may be decreased by explicitly satisfying the displacement-velocity compatibility condition (cf. Equation 3.4). In the u-TDG/FEM, however, the requirement of at-least quadratic time interpolation of the displacement implies that minimum three unknowns should be determined for each time-slab \\(I_{n}\\). One of the objectives of this thesis is to further decrease the number of unknowns in a given time-slab. To achieve this goal a velocity based single-field TDG/FEM (henceforth, v-TDG/FEM) is developed.\nThe key idea behind the v-TDG/FEM is to treat the velocity as the only primary unknown. In \\(I_{n}\\), the velocity is interpolated using the Lagrange polynomials of degree \\(p\\); the velocity remains continuous in \\(I_{n}\\), but discontinuity occurs at the end-points \\(t_{n},t_{n+1}\\). Further, a consistent time-integration of the velocity is performed as post-processing step to compute the displacement. Thus, the displacement-velocity compatibility relationship is naturally satisfied, and Equation 3.4 is no longer required to be solved. Regarding the v-TDG/FEM, it is worth mentioning that the displacement remains continuous throughout the time domain \\(\\left[0,T\\right]\\), whereas in the uv-TDG/FEM and u-TDG/FEM displacement is discontinuous at the discrete times \\(\\left\\{ t_{0},t_{1},\\cdots,t_{N}\\right\\}\\).\nThe weak form of the v-TDG/FEM, which is described below (see Equation 3.32), is obtained by considering the first order ODE given by Equation 3.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeakform\n\n\n\nWeak-form 3.

In addition, \\(v_{1}^{(n)}=v_{n}^{+}\\), \\(v_{2}^{(n)}=v_{n+1}^{-}\\).\nConsequently, the discrete form of the displacement-velocity compatibility relationship, which is described below, can be obtained by using the above-mentioned trial functions for the velocity in the Equation 3.33.\n\\[\nu^{h}(t)=u^{h}({t_{n}})+\\sum\\limits_{a=1}^{p+1}{\\tilde{T}_{a}^{(p)}v_{a}^{(n)}}\n\\tag{3.35}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\tilde{T}_{a}^{(p)}=\\frac{{\\Delta{t_{n}}}}{2}\\int_{-1}^{+1}{T_{a}^{(p)}d\\theta}\n\\tag{3.36}\\]\nare \\(p+1\\) order locally defined polynomials.\n\nRemark 3.7. In Equation 3.35 by the virtue of time integration of the \\(p\\)-order Lagrange polynomials, the displacement are described by the \\(p+1\\)-order local piecewise polynomials. In addition, Eq.

The undamped time period \\(T_{0}\\) of the sinusoidal motion is \\(1.0\\) second, and the total time duration is taken as \\(T=50\\) seconds. Figure 3.3 plots the time history graphs of the normalized total energy computed by using the TDG schemes with different time-step sizes. As anticipated, the energy dissipation in the case of uv-TDG/FEM is relatively higher than the other two schemes. In addition, the energy decay characteristics of the u-TDG/FEM and v-TDG/FEM are identical to each other. Furthermore, the dissipation of energy decreases as the time-step size decreases (see also Figure 3.2) which indicates that the jump discontinuity in time decreases with time-step size. In fact, the subsequent sections will demonstrate that the jump discontinuity in time decreases with time-step size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Spring-mass system – Time history of the normalized total energy obtained by using the v-TDG/FEM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Spring-mass system – Time history graphs of the normalized total energy obtained by using different TDG schemes.\n\n\n\nThe effect of energy-dissipation can be visualized from the displacement-velocity phase diagram.

The presence of energy dissipation in the numerical algorithm, however, decreases the total energy which in the turn decreases the radii of the ellipse.

Equation 3.57) and Equation 3.60. Therefore, the stability and accuracy characteristics of these two methods will be identical, and henceforth only the case of the v-TDG/FEM and uv-TDG/FEM will be discussed.\n\nThe stability of the TDG schemes is determined by the spectral properties of the amplification matrix. Let \\(\\lambda_{1}(\\mathbf{A})\\) and \\(\\lambda_{2}(\\mathbf{A})\\) be the eigenvalues of the amplification matrix. Accordingly, it can be shown that\n\\[\n\\lambda_{1,2}(\\mathbf{A})=a_{1}\\pm\\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}-a_{2}}\n\\tag{3.61}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{a_{1}} & =\\frac{1}{2}\\left({{A_{11}}+{A_{22}}}\\right), & {a_{2}} & ={A_{11}}{A_{22}}-{A_{12}}{A_{21}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3.62}\\]\nThe modulus of \\(\\lambda_{i}(\\mathbf{A})\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\left|{{\\lambda_{i}}}\\right|=\\sqrt{{\\lambda_{i}}{\\lambda_{i}}^{*}}\\quad\\text{no sum for index i},\n\\]\nwhere \\({{\\lambda_{i}}^{*}}\\) denotes the complex conjugate of \\(\\lambda_{i}\\).

Therefore, TDG/FEM schemes are unconditionally stable time-marching schemes.\nAlternatively, for a \\(2\\times2\\) amplification matrix, the spectral stability can be examined by using the technique originally developed by the Hilber (Hughes 1983 for derivation). Hilber technique for the stability of the algorithm is specified in terms of the invariants of amplification matrix; \\(a_{1}\\) and \\(a_{2}\\). The stability region in \\(a_{1}-a_{2}\\) space satisfies (see also Figure 3.7)\n\\[\n-\\frac{{\\left({{a_{2}}+1}\\right)}}{2}\\leqslant{a_{1}}\\leqslant\\frac{{\\left({{a_{2}}+1}\\right)}}{2},\\qquad-1\\leqslant{a_{2}}&lt;1\n\\tag{3.64}\\]\n\\[\n-1&lt;{a_{1}}&lt;1,\\qquad{a_{2}}=1\n\\tag{3.65}\\]\nFigure 3.7 and Figure 3.7 b depict the stability region corresponding to Eq.

It can be observed that the \\(a_{1}\\) and \\(a_{2}\\) for the TDG/FEM are located inside the Hilber stability region, therefore, proving the unconditional stability of the uv-TDG/FEM and v-TDG/FEM.",

Moreover, High-frequency response of the spectral radius \\(\\rho(\\mathbf{A})\\) provides the informations regarding the numerical stability and numerical dissipation of the spurious high-frequency components Hughes (1983, 2012). Figure 3.9 a depicts the frequency responses of the spectral radius for the uv-TDG/FEM and v-TDG/FEM. Furthermore, in Figure 3.9 b spectral radius of TDG schemes are plotted along with the semi-discrete algorithms. Once again it can be observed that v-TDG/FEM and uv-TDG/FEM are unconditionally stable algorithms as \\(\\rho\\le1\\).\nFor uv-TDG/FEM, spectral radius in the high-frequency regime (i.e., \\({\\rho_{\\infty}}:=\\mathop{\\lim}\\limits_{\\Omega\\to\\infty}\\rho\\)), reaches to zero, consequently, the algorithm can dissipate the spurious high-frequency response. The v-TDG/FEM, however, cannot attenuate such spurious high-frequency contents since \\(\\rho_{\\infty}=1\\) (see Figure 3.9). The spectral radius for the v-TDG/FEM is lower than that of uv-TDG/FEM, therefore, the former has lower numerical dissipation than the latter.

Lastly, the points \\(\\Omega\\approx\\pi\\) and \\(\\Omega\\approx3.4\\pi\\), at which spectral radius for the v-TDG/FEM attains its minimum value, mark the bifurcation of complex conjugate eigenvalues into distinct real eigenvalues (see Figure 3.9 a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Frequency response of spectral radius \\(\\rho\\): (a) uv-TDG/FEM and v-TDG/FEM, and (b) comparison of spectral radii for TDG schemes with the semi-discrete algorithms.",

Furthermore, Equation 3.69 proves that both TDG schemes are third order accurate in time.\nSince uv-TDG/FEM and v-TDG/FEM are both consistent and stable one can use the Lax equivalence theorem to prove the convergence of the algorithms. A direct consequence of the convergence is that there exists an \\(\\Omega_{c}&gt;0\\) such that if \\(0&lt;\\Omega&lt;\\Omega_{c}\\), then the eigenvalues of amplification matrix are complex, i.e., \\(a_{1}^{2}-{a_{2}}&lt;0\\) in Equation 3.61, and the solution of Equation 3.48 can be written as follows (Hughes 1983):\n\\[\n{u_{n}}=\\exp\\left({-\\frac{{\\bar{\\zeta}\\,\\bar{\\Omega}{t_{n}}}}{{\\Delta t}}}\\right)\\left[{{k_{1}}\\cos\\left({\\frac{{\\bar{\\Omega}{t_{n}}}}{{\\Delta t}}}\\right)+{k_{2}}\\sin\\left({\\frac{{\\bar{\\Omega}{t_{n}}}}{{\\Delta t}}}\\right)}\\right]\n\\tag{3.70}\\]\nwith\n\\[\n\\bar{\\Omega}=\\arctan\\left({\\frac{{\\sqrt{{a_{2}}-a_{1}^{2}}}}{{{a_{1}}}}}\\right)\n\\tag{3.71}\\]\n\\[\n\\bar{\\zeta}=-\\frac{1}{{2\\bar{\\Omega}}}\\ln\\left({{a_{2}}}\\right)\n\\tag{3.72}\\]\nhere, \\(\\bar{\\zeta}\\) denotes the algorithmic damping ratio, \\(\\bar{\\Omega}\\) is the frequency of the discrete solutions, and the coefficients \\(k_{1}\\) and \\(k_{2}\\) are determined by the displacement and velocity initial conditions.

Therefore, it is appropriate to use the algorithmic damping ratio \\(\\bar{\\zeta}\\) and the relative frequency error \\((\\Omega-\\bar{\\Omega})/\\bar{\\Omega}\\) as the measures of numerical dissipation and dispersion, respectively.\nNumerical dissipation is the measure of amplitude decay in each cycle, while numerical dispersion measures the relative change in the time period of the wave (see Figure 3.10). Thus, the numerical algorithms designed for long-term dynamic simulations should have little numerical dissipation and dispersion. Moreover, it is important to note that both numerical dissipation and dispersion are computed from complex eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_{1,2}(\\mathbf{(}A))\\), thus, they are meaningful for the small frequency range of \\(0&lt;\\Omega&lt;\\Omega_{c}\\).\nThe behavior of relative frequency error for the uv-TDG/FEM, v-TDG/FEM and semi-discrete algorithms in low frequency domain is presented in Figure 3.11. It is remarkable that the TDG schemes have very less relative frequency error compare to the semi-discrete algorithms which can be attributed to the third order accuracy of these schemes. Furthermore, relative frequency error for the v-TDG/FEM is significantly smaller than the error in uv-TDG/FEM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: Relative frequency error in the low frequency domain: (a) uv-TDG/FEM and v-TDG/FEM, and (b) comparison of the relative frequency error for the TDG schemes with the semi-discrete algorithms.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12 depicts the behavior of algorithm damping ratio for the uv-TDG/FEM, v-TDG/FEM and semi-discrete algorithms. The algorithmic damping for v-TDG/FEM is comparable with the HHT-\\(\\alpha\\) scheme, however, it is significantly smaller than the uv-TDG/FEM. It is evident that the Houbolt and Wilson-\\(\\theta\\) methods are too dissipative in the low-frequency range, therefore, these algorithms are not suitable for the long-duration numerical simulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: Algorithmic damping ratio in the low frequency domain: (a) uv-TDG/FEM and v-TDG/FEM, and (b) comparison of the algorithmic damping ratio for the TDG schemes with the semi-discrete algorithms.\n\n\n\n\nRemark 3.8. The characteristics of the proposed v-TDG/FEM, such as very low numerical dispersion and dissipation, third-order accuracy, and unconditional stability, make v-TDG/FEM scheme suitable for long-time simulations.

    "text": "In many fields of both engineering and physics the problems ranging from simulation of earthquake ground motion (Bao et al. 1998; Bielak et al. 2003) and dynamic soil-structure interaction (John Wolf 1985; J. Wolf and Hall 1988), to electromagnetic waves (Chew 1995), and quantum mechanics (Alonso-Mallo and Reguera 2003) may be best represented or modeled by considering the linear wave propagation on infinite or semi-infinite unbounded domain. Such modeling is especially of interest in the design of earth-structures such as dam, tunnels, embankments, hospital and residential buildings etc. against the transient loading and vibrations caused by the high-speed trains, road-traffic, underground explosions, and more importantly earthquake motion. In these problems the finite dimensional structure dynamically interacts with the adjacent unbounded soil domain, and therefore the two domains mutually influence the dynamic responses of each other (J. P. Wolf and Song 1996; Burman et al. 2012).\nFor the computation of the dynamic SSI problems, a surface called interaction horizon  (J. P. Wolf and Song 1996) that encloses the structure and forms the boundary of the computational domain has to be selected. The objective of these domain reduction techniques is twofold; decreasing the computation burden by reducing the size of the problem and enforcing the so called radiation condition thus prohibiting any spurious reflections at the artificial truncated boundaries (ATB). In this way, ATB simulate the effects of the far field on the dynamic response of both the structure and the near field.\nThe structure of the chapter is as follows. In section 2 of this chapter basic theory of wave propagation in elastic solids is given. Section 3 of this chapter reviews some of the most popular boundary conditions for solving wave propagation problems in unbounded domains. Section 4 of this chapter provides the derivation of viscous boundary condition first proposed by (Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer 1969) and discusses its characteristics. Subsequently, in section 5 of this chapter, viscous boundary conditions are modified to allow seismic excitation to enter the computational domain.\nLinear and nonlinear dynamic response of the deformable media can be described by a wave propagation phenomenon. A deformable media subjected to a transient loading condition produces mechanical waves; as elements of the medium are deformed the disturbance is transmitted from one point in space to the next. The local mechanical disturbances of a medium is not instantaneously detected at positions that are at a distance from the region of excitation. It takes time for a disturbance to propagate from its source to other positions. In this way as the disturbance propagates through the medium it carries along amounts of energy due to motions of particles of medium about their equilibrium position.\nFurther, the transmission of mechanical wave depends mainly upon the deformation characteristics and inertia of the medium. As it will be seen later both stiffness and inertia of a medium tend decrease the wave speed. A rigid medium, (e.g. rocks with very high stiffness) deforms insignificantly and the mechanical disturbance travels almost instantaneously in it. Similarly, a hypothetical massless medium (i.e. no inertia) allows mechanical wave to travel without any delay. These concepts have been used widely to model the interaction between the soil/rock foundation and the earth structures such as concrete gravity dams. It is important to note that the inertia of a system first offers resistance to motion, but once the medium is in motion inertia with the resilience of the medium tends to sustain the motion (Achenbach 2012).\n\n\n\n\nAchenbach, Jan D. 2012.

Since the phase velocity does not depend upon the wave number (or the wavelength), the plane harmonic waves in unbounded homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic media are not dispersive.\nNoting Equation 5.14 and Equation 5.18 the longitudinal plane harmonic wave traveling in \\(\\left( x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)\\) plane in the direction \\(\\mathbf{p}=\\left[ \\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta,0 \\right]\\) can be described as follows\n\\[\n{\\mathbf{u}} = A\\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  {\\sin \\theta } \\\\\n  {\\cos \\theta } \\\\\n  0\n\\end{array}} \\right]\\exp \\left[ {ik\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta_1} + {x_2}\\cos {\\theta_2} - {c_L}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.19}\\]\nSimilarly, using Equation 5.16 in Equation 5.18 the SV-wave traveling in \\(\\left( x_{1}, x_{2}\\right)\\) plane and in the direction \\(\\mathbf{p}=\\left[ \\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta,0 \\right]\\) is given by\n\\[\n{\\mathbf{u}} = A\\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  { - \\cos \\theta } \\\\\n  {\\sin \\theta } \\\\\n  0\n\\end{array}} \\right]\\exp \\left[ {ik\\left( {{x_1}\\sin \\theta  + {x_2}\\cos \\theta  - {c_T}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.20}\\]\nThe equation of SH-wave propagating in the direction \\(\\mathbf{p}=\\left[ \\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta,0 \\right]\\) can be obtained by using Equation 5.17\n\\[\n{u_3} = A\\exp \\left[ {ik\\left( {{x_1}\\sin \\theta  + {x_2}\\cos \\theta  - {c_T}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.21}\\]\nFor the displacement given by Equation 5.18 the stresses generated in the elastic body are computed using the Hooke’s law (see Eq.

    "text": "5.4 Reflection and refraction of plane waves\nThe presence of different materials significantly affects the systems of waves propagating through that medium. When waves reach the interface between two medium with different material properties, part of the wave is reflected and the part is transmitted through the interface (Achenbach 2012). The ratio of the mechanical impedances of two media completely determines the nature of the reflection and the transmission at the interface.\nIn such system of material discontinuity, system of plane waves — reflected and refracted waves at the interface — can be superposed to represent an incident wave. For a given incident wave, the amplitude \\(A\\), the unit propagation vectors \\(\\mathbf{p}\\) and the wave numbers \\(k\\) of the reflected and refracted waves are computed by satisfying the continuity conditions on the displacements and stress at the interface between two media.\nConsider two joined elastic half-spaces in \\(\\left( x_1, x_2 \\right)\\) plane. Let \\(x_2 = 0\\) be the interface plane between these two media. The material properties of the medium carrying the incident and reflected waves (i.e. \\(x_2&lt;0\\)) are the Lame elastic constants \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\mu\\), velocity of longitudinal wave \\(c_L\\), velocity of transverse wave \\(c_T\\) and the mass density \\(\\rho\\). Similarly, the material constants of the medium into which refraction takes place are \\(\\lambda^{B}, \\mu^{B}, c^{B}_{L}, c^{B}_{T}, \\rho^{B}\\). The superscript with a number \\(n=1,2,3,4\\) enclosed in parenthesis is used for denoting the reflected and refracted waves. The number 0 is used for denoting the incidental wave.\n\n5.4.1 Reflection and refraction of SH-wave:\nConsider the following incidental SH-wave traveling in the direction \\(\\mathbf{p}=\\left[ \\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta,0 \\right]\\) (see Figure 5.3).\n\\[\nu_3^{\\left( 0 \\right)} = {A_0}\\exp \\left[ {i{k_0}\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta _0} + {x_2}\\cos {\\theta _0} - {c_T}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.23}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Reflection of SH-wave at the boundary\n\n\n\nThe reflection and refraction of SH-wave at the interface generates the SH-wave. The system of waves should satisfy the continuity of the displacement and stress at the interface; displacement (stress) due to the incidental and reflected wave should be equal to the displacement(stress) due to the refracted wave. Accordingly, the equations of reflected and refracted wave are given by\n\\[\nu_3^{\\left( 2 \\right)} =  {A_2}\\exp \\left[ {i{k_0}\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta_0} + {x_2}\\cos {\\theta_0} - {c_T}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.24}\\]\n\\[\nu_3^{\\left( 4 \\right)} =  {A_4}\\exp \\left[ {i{k_4}\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta_4} + {x_2}\\cos {\\theta_4} - {c_{T}^{B}}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.25}\\]\nwhere \\(A_2, A_4, \\theta_4, k_4\\) are given by following relations\n\\[\n\\frac{{{A_2}}}{{{A_0}}} = \\frac{{\\mu \\cos {\\theta _0} - {\\mu ^B}\\left( {{c_T}/c_T^B} \\right)\\cos {\\theta_4}}}{{\\mu \\cos {\\theta _0} + {\\mu ^B}\\left( {{c_T}/c_T^B} \\right)\\cos {\\theta_4}}}\n\\tag{5.26}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{{{A_4}}}{{{A_0}}} = \\frac{{2\\mu \\cos {\\theta _0}}}{{\\mu \\cos {\\theta_0} + {\\mu ^B}\\left( {{c_T}/c_T^B} \\right)\\cos {\\theta _4}}}\n\\]\n\\[\n{k_4} = \\frac{{{c_T}}}{{c_T^B}}{k_0}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin {\\theta _4} = \\frac{{c_T^B}}{{{c_T}}}\\sin {\\theta_0}\n\\tag{5.27}\\]\nThe inspection of Equation 2.24 – Equation 2.30 leads to several observations:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reflected wave is in phase with the incident wave and the wave-number and phase-velocity of incident and reflected wave are the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefracted wave separates from the incident wave while moving away from the normal if \\(c_{T}^{B}&gt;c_{T}\\), and it moves towards the normal in case \\(c_{T}^{B}&lt;c_{T}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wave is completely transmitted (i.e. \\(A_2=0\\)) if\n\\[\n\\mu \\cos {\\theta _0} - {\\mu ^B}\\left( {{c_T}/c_T^B} \\right)\\cos {\\theta_4} = 0\n\\]\nwhich leads to\n\\[\n\\cos {\\theta _0} = \\sqrt {\\frac{{1 - {{\\left( {{c_T}/c_T^B} \\right)}^2}}}{{1 - {{\\left( {\\mu /{\\mu ^B}} \\right)}^2}}}}\n\\]\nTherefore, a combination of angle of incidence and material properties is possible for which no SH-wave is reflected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the half-space \\(x_{2}&gt;0\\) is vacuum (i.e., the interface is boundary of elastic half-space) then there will be no reflected waves. Further, if the boundary condition condition at \\(x_2=0\\) is such that total displacement vanishes then the reflected wave will have \\(180\\,^{\\circ}\\) phase difference with the incident wave. Furthermore, if the total stress at the boundary vanishes then the reflected wave is in phase with the incident wave.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.2 Reflection and refraction of longitudinal wave\nAs mentioned earlier, in case of longitudinal wave (or P-wave) material points move in the direction of wave propagation (see Equation 5.15). The equation of incidental longitudinal wave traveling in the direction \\(\\mathbf{p}=\\left[ \\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta,0 \\right]\\) is given by\n\\[\n{{\\mathbf{u}}^{\\left( 0 \\right)}} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  {\\sin {\\theta _0}} \\\\\n  {\\cos {\\theta_0}} \\\\\n  0\n\\end{array}} \\right]{A_0}\\exp \\left[ {i{k_0}\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta_0} + {x_2}\\cos {\\theta_0} - {c_L}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.28}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Reflection of P-wave at the boundary\n\n\n\nWhen a P-wave encounters a material interface two reflected (a P-wave and a SV-wave) and two refracted waves (a P-wave and a SV-wave) are possible. The motion of system of waves is depicted in Figure 5.4. The equation of reflected P-wave and SV-wave is given by Equation 5.29 and Equation 5.30, respectively.\n\\[\n{{\\mathbf{u}}^{\\left( 1 \\right)}} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  {\\sin {\\theta _1}} \\\\\n  { - \\cos {\\theta_1}} \\\\\n  0\n\\end{array}} \\right]{A_1}\\exp \\left[ {i{k_1}\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta_1} - {x_2}\\cos {\\theta_1} - {c_L}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.29}\\]\n\\[\n{{\\mathbf{u}}^{\\left( 2 \\right)}} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  {\\cos {\\theta _2}} \\\\\n  {\\sin {\\theta_2}} \\\\\n  {0}\n\\end{array}} \\right]{A_2}\\exp \\left[ {i{k_2}\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta_2} - {x_2}\\cos {\\theta_2} - {c_T}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.30}\\]\nThe equation of refracted P-wave and SV-wave is given by Equation 5.31 and Equation 5.32, respectively.\n\\[\n{{\\mathbf{u}}^{\\left( 3 \\right)}} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  {\\sin {\\theta _3}} \\\\\n  {\\cos {\\theta_3}} \\\\\n  0\n\\end{array}} \\right]{A_3}\\exp \\left[ {i{k_3}\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta_3} + {x_2}\\cos {\\theta_3} - c_L^Bt} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.31}\\]\n\\[\n{{\\mathbf{u}}^{\\left( 4 \\right)}} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  { - \\cos {\\theta _4}} \\\\\n  {\\sin {\\theta_4}} \\\\\n  0\n\\end{array}} \\right]{A_4}\\exp \\left[ {i{k_4}\\left( {{x_1}\\sin {\\theta_4} + {x_2}\\cos {\\theta_4} - c_T^Bt} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{5.32}\\]\nThis system of waves should satisfy four continuity equations at the interface; one for each \\(u_{1}, u_{2}, \\sigma_{12}, \\sigma_{22}\\). In other words, total displacement (total stress) due to system of incident and reflected waves must be equal to the total displacement (total stress) due to the system of refracted waves. Accordingly, one can obtain following results for the wave-numbers and direction of wave propagation.\n\\[{k_1} = {k_0};\\quad \\,{\\theta _1} = {\\theta _0}\\]\n\\[{k_2} = {k_0}\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{{c_T}}};\\quad \\,\\sin {\\theta _2} = \\frac{{{c_T}}}{{{c_L}}}\\sin {\\theta _0}\\]\n\\[{k_3} = {k_0}\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{c_L^B}};\\quad \\,\\sin {\\theta _3} = \\frac{{c_L^B}}{{{c_L}}}\\sin {\\theta _0}\\]\n\\[{k_4} = {k_0}\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{c_T^B}};\\quad \\,\\sin {\\theta _4} = \\frac{{c_T^B}}{{{c_L}}}\\sin {\\theta _0}\\]\nSubsequently, the aforementioned four continuity equations results in four linear equations for the amplitudes \\(A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}\\) and \\(A_{4}\\). In matrix form the system can be represented by\n\\[\\mathbf{T}\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}_{0}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n{\\mathbf{T}} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  { - \\sin {\\theta _1}}&{ - \\cos {\\theta_2}}&{\\sin {\\theta _3}}&{ - \\cos {\\theta_4}} \\\\\n  {\\cos {\\theta _1}}&{ - \\sin {\\theta_2}}&{\\cos {\\theta _3}}&{\\sin {\\theta_4}} \\\\\n  {\\sin 2{\\theta _1}}&{\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{{c_T}}}\\cos 2{\\theta_2}}&{\\frac{{{\\mu ^B}}}{\\mu }\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{c_L^B}}\\sin 2{\\theta _3}}&{ - \\frac{{{\\mu ^B}}}{\\mu }\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{c_T^B}}\\cos 2{\\theta_4}} \\\\\n  { - {{\\left( {\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{{c_T}}}} \\right)}^2}\\cos 2{\\theta _2}}&{\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{{c_T}}}\\sin 2{\\theta_2}}&{\\frac{{{\\mu ^B}}}{\\mu }\\frac{{{c_L}{c^B}_L}}{{{{\\left( {c_T^B} \\right)}^2}}}\\cos 2{\\theta_4}}&{\\frac{{{\\mu ^B}}}{\\mu }\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{c_T^B}}\\sin 2{\\theta _4}}\n\\end{array}} \\right]\n\\]\n\\[\n{\\mathbf{A}} = {\\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  {{A_1}}&{{A_2}}&{{A_3}}&{{A_4}}\n\\end{array}} \\right]^T}\n\\]\n\\[\n{{\\mathbf{A}}_0} = {A_0}\\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  {\\sin {\\theta _0}}&{\\cos {\\theta_0}}&{\\sin 2{\\theta _0}}&{{{\\left( {\\frac{{{c_L}}}{{{c_T}}}} \\right)}^2}\\cos 2{\\theta_2}}\n\\end{array}} \\right]^{T}\n\\]\nIn case of normal incident of P-wave (i.e., \\(\\theta_{0}=0\\)) the reflected and refracted waves contains only a P-wave, i.e.\n\\[A_{2}=A_{4}=0\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\frac{{{A_1}}}{{{A_0}}} = \\frac{{{\\rho ^B}c_L^B - \\rho {c_L}}}{{{\\rho ^B}c_L^B + \\rho {c_L}}}\n\\tag{5.33}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{{{A_3}}}{{{A_0}}} = \\frac{{2\\rho {c_L}}}{{{\\rho ^B}c_L^B + \\rho {c_L}}}\n\\tag{5.34}\\]\nFrom Equation 5.33 and Equation 5.34 it is clear that in case of normal incidence of P-wave the amplitude of reflected and refracted P-wave depends entirely on the mechanical impedance, the product of mass density and phase speed, of the two media. If both media have the same mechanical impedance then there will be no reflected wave. Further, if upper half-space has more impedance then lower half-space then the reflected P-wave will be out of phase with the incident wave.\nIn case upper half-space is vacuum – the interface becomes the boundary of elastic half-space – then there will be no refracted waves and system of reflected wave will consist a P-wave and a SV-wave. The nature of reflected waves then depends upon the boundary conditions. If the total displacement at the boundary vanishes then the reflected P-wave and SV-wave are given by Equation 5.29 and Equation 5.30, respectively, with amplitudes,\n\\[\n\\frac{{{A_1}}}{{{A_0}}} = \\frac{{\\cos \\left( {{\\theta _0} + {\\theta_2}} \\right)}}{{\\cos \\left( {{\\theta _0} - {\\theta_2}} \\right)}}\n\\tag{5.35}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{{{A_2}}}{{{A_0}}} = \\frac{{\\sin 2{\\theta _0}}}{{\\cos \\left( {{\\theta_0} - {\\theta _2}} \\right)}}\n\\tag{5.36}\\]\nIf the total stress at the boundary vanishes (i.e., stress free surface) then the amplitude ratio becomes\n\\[\n\\frac{{{A_1}}}{{{A_0}}} = \\frac{{\\sin 2{\\theta _0}\\sin 2{\\theta_2} - {\\kappa ^2}{{\\cos }^2}{\\theta _2}}}{{\\sin 2{\\theta_0}\\sin 2{\\theta _2} + {\\kappa ^2}{{\\cos }^2}2{\\theta_2}}}\n\\tag{5.37}\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{{{A_2}}}{{{A_0}}} = \\frac{{2\\kappa \\sin 2{\\theta _0}\\cos 2{\\theta_2}}}{{\\sin 2{\\theta _0}\\sin 2{\\theta_2} + {\\kappa ^2}{{\\cos }^2}2{\\theta _2}}}\n\\tag{5.38}\\]\nFrom Equation 5.37 – Equation 5.38 it is observed that normal incident, \\(\\theta_{0}=0\\), and grazing incident, \\(\\theta_{0}=\\pi/2\\), of P-wave generates only a reflected P-wave as \\(A_2=0\\). In former case the reflected P-wave is in the phase, and in later case reflected P-wave is out of phase with incident wave.\n\n\n\n\nAchenbach, Jan D. 2012. Wave propagation in elastic solids.

    "text": "So far we have discussed the homogeneous plane harmonic waves where the amplitude of wave motion remains constant in the plane of constant phase. There exists another type of wave motion for which the amplitude changes in the plane of constant phase. Consequently, one can define the plane of constant amplitude. It turns out that the two planes are normal to each other. Moreover, the plane of constant phase moves in the direction of wave propagation, therefore, the amplitude remains constant in the wave propagation direction.\nSurface waves are inhomogeneous plane waves for which amplitude of disturbance exponentially decays as one moves away from the surface. However, the amplitude of motion remains constant in the wave direction of wave propagation. From an earthquake engineering viewpoint two type of surface waves are of primary importance; Rayleigh wave and Love wave.\nConsider the in-plane motion of plane waves traveling in \\(x_1\\)-direction in a homogeneous elastic half-space (\\(x_{2} \\le 0\\)) with free surface at \\(x_2 = 0\\). The Motion of particles as the wave passes by can be described as,\n\\[\n{u_1} = \\left[ {{A_1}\\exp \\left( {{b_1}{x_2}} \\right) + {A_2}\\exp \\left( {{b_2}{x_2}} \\right)} \\right]\\exp \\left[ {i{k_R}\\left( {{x_1} - {c_R}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\n\\[\n{u_2} = \\left[ { - {A_1}\\frac{{{b_1}}}{{i{k_R}}}\\exp \\left( {{b_1}{x_2}} \\right) + {A_2}\\frac{{i{k_R}}}{{{b_2}}}\\exp \\left( {{b_2}{x_2}} \\right)} \\right]\\exp \\left[ {i{k_R}\\left( {{x_1} - {c_R}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{6.2}\\]\nwhere \\(A_{1},A_{2}\\) are constants to be determined, \\(k_{R}\\) and \\(c_R\\) are the wave number and phase-velocity of the Rayleigh wave, respectively. \\(b_{1}\\) and \\(b_{2}\\) are given by\n\\[{b_1} = {k_R}{\\left( {1 - \\frac{{c_R^2}}{{c_L^2}}} \\right)^{1/2}}\\]\n\\[{b_2} = {k_R}{\\left( {1 - \\frac{{c_R^2}}{{c_T^2}}} \\right)^{1/2}}\\]\nNote that for \\(b_{1}, b_{2}\\) are real valued if \\(c_{R}&lt;c_{T}&lt;c_{L}\\). The mathematical expressions for \\(A_{1}, A_{2}\\) and \\(c_{R}\\) are obtained by satisfying the stress free conditions (i.e. \\(\\sigma_{22}=\\sigma_{12}=0\\)) at \\(x_2=0\\). Subsequently, one can obtain the following relationship between the constants \\(A_{1}\\) and \\(A_{2}\\)\n\\[\n{A_2} =  - \\frac{{2{b_1}{b_2}}}{{\\left( {k_R^2 + b_2^2} \\right)}}{A_1}\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nThe approximate value for \\(c_R\\) can be given by (Achenbach 2012)\n\\[\n{c_R} = \\frac{{0.862 + 1.14\\nu }}{{1 + \\nu }}{c_T}\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nwhere \\(\\nu\\) denotes the Poisson’s ratio of the elastic half-space.\nUsing Equation 6.3 – Equation 6.4 in Equation 6.1 and Equation 6.2 following expression for displacement components can be obtained.\n\\[\n{u_1} = {A_1}\\left[ {\\exp \\left( {{b_1}{x_2}} \\right) - \\frac{{2{b_1}{b_2}}}{{k_R^2 + b_2^2}}\\exp \\left( {{b_2}{x_2}} \\right)} \\right]\\exp \\left[ {i{k_R}\\left( {{x_1} - {c_R}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{6.5}\\]\n\\[\n{u_2} = i{A_1}\\left[ {\\frac{{{b_1}}}{{{k_R}}}\\exp \\left( {{b_1}{x_2}} \\right) - \\frac{{2{b_1}{k_R}}}{{k_R^2 + b_2^2}}\\exp \\left( {{b_2}{x_2}} \\right)} \\right]\\exp \\left[ {i{k_R}\\left( {{x_1} - {c_R}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\tag{6.6}\\]\nFrom Equation 6.5 – Equation 6.6, it can be observed that the horizontal and vertical displacement components, \\(u_{1}, u_{2}\\), have a \\(90\\,^{\\circ}\\) phase difference; when \\(u_1\\) is maximum then \\(u_2\\) is zero, and vice versa. Due to \\(90\\,^{\\circ}\\) phase difference in \\(u_{1}, u_{2}\\) the trajectories of the particles are ellipses, and particles at the free surfaces moves counter-clockwise when wave travels in positive \\(x_1\\) direction. At depth \\(x_{2}\\approx 0.2 \\Lambda\\) the direction of rotation changes (Here \\(\\Lambda\\) denotes the wavelength of Rayleigh wave). It can be shown that at the free surface the normal displacement is about 1.5 times the tangential displacement.\nIt should be noted that in a homogeneous elastic half-space only Rayleigh wave and body waves can exist. However, Love waves can arise if soil layering is present. Love waves typically develop in shallow surface soil layers overlying layers of stiffer materials properties. They basically consists of SH-waves that are trapped by multiple reflection within the surface layer. Exactly like SH-waves Love waves propagates in the out-of-plane direction and they have no vertical components of particle motion.\n\n\n\n\nAchenbach, Jan D. 2012. Wave propagation in elastic solids.

    "text": "7.1 Review of artificial boundary conditions\nDynamic soil-structure problems can be viewed as a wave propagation problem. Consider a structure (finite dimension) embedded in the unbounded domain of semi-infinite soil (see Figure 7.1). The soil domain can further be divided into two regions; (i) the irregular bounded region near to the structure, and (ii) the regular unbounded region extending to infinity. Both structure and irregular bounded region are allowed to exhibit nonlinear behaviour. However, note that the regular unbounded region must remain linear1. Henceforth the term structure will be used to denote system of irregular bounded region and structure and the term unbounded domain will be used for denoting the regular unbounded region. The dynamic soil-structure interaction occurs through the interface between unbounded domain and structure.\nFor finite element analysis of dynamic SSI problems, a superficial surface called interaction-horizon that encloses the structure and forms the boundary of the computational domain has to be selected (John P. Wolf and Song 1996). The key issue of this approach is to impose the so called artificial boundary conditions (ABC) so that the interaction-horizon can model the radiation damping accurately and spurious reflections from the boundaries can be prohibited. In literature these boundary conditions have been known as absorbing, non-reflecting, transparent, silent, and one-way boundary conditions. Further, the use of ABC’s enables one to get rid of the exterior unbounded domain from the computations.\nTo appreciate the radiation damping, consider a vertically propagating SV-wave in a elastic half-space with two layers of soil (see Figure 7.2). The normal incidence of SV-wave at the interface of two layers produces reflected and refracted SV-waves. As it was shown earlier the partition of the wave depends upon the mechanical impedance of the two media. The wave reflected to lower half-space never returns to the interface due to its infinite extension in \\(x_2\\)-direction. This loss of energy is known as radiation damping (Kramer 2014). Further, refracted wave approaches the free surface layered system and subsequently reflected back towards the interface. At the interface when this wave reaches again a part of energy is reflected back and a part of the energy is transmitted to the lower half-space and therefore it will be lost in the semi-infinite domain of bottom layer. This loss of energy represents again the radiation damping. One of the big challenges of dynamic finite element analysis is to model correctly this radiation damping. Further, difficulties arises due to the presence of structures (such as dam, tunnel, buildings etc.) in or on the half-space that causes multiple reflection and refraction of incoming waves.\nThe minimal requirements of ABC’s presented by (D. Givoli 1991) are; (a) the problem in truncated domain with ABC should be mathematically well posed, (b) ABC’s should allow the waves that come from inside the computational domain to go out2 and produces little spurious reflections at the artificial boundaries, (c) the solutions of truncated problem in some sense should be close enough to the original problem in unbounded domain, (d) the combination of a numerical scheme and ABC’s should yield a stable numerical method, (e) ABC should be easy to implement and the cost of implementation should not be huge.\nKausel and Tassoulas in their review paper (Kausel and Tassoulas 1981) grouped ABC’s into following three categories;",

    "section": "7.2 Local artificial boundary conditions",
    "text": "7.2 Local artificial boundary conditions\nThe first attempt to simulate radiation with simple local boundaries was presented by (Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer 1969). These authors developed viscous boundary conditions based on physical consideration. In essence, these conditions can be interpreted as dashpots connected to the boundary points. The damping coefficient was given by the mechanical impedance of the soil to which dashpots were attached to. The derivation of this type of boundary condition is considered in the next section.\n(Smith 1974) used the principle of superposition to filter out the contribution of spurious reflections from the solutions. Two solutions were obtained corresponding to the two types of boundary conditions; one in which tangential displacement and normal stresses vanishes, another in which normal displacement and tangential stresses vanishes. The reflected P-wave and S-wave corresponding to these boundary conditions have the same amplitude but they have phase difference of \\(180 \\,^{\\circ}\\). However, this approach is computationally not efficient, moreover this approach is limited to the linear problem only.\n(Engquist and Majda 1977) and (R. W. Clayton and Egquist 1977), developed a set of time-dependent local-ABC of increasing order based on paraxial approximations of the scalar and elastic wave equation. In their technique they approximated the irrational dispersion relation by a rational function to obtain the local differential operator from the nonlocal pseudodifferential operators. In this way by using rational approximations of increasing order, they obtain local boundary conditions of increasing accuracy. Further, they mentioned that a higher order paraxial approximation based on Taylor series expansions induces numerical instability. Although this difficulty can be overcome by use of Pade approximations instead of Taylor series expansions, the presence of higher order derivatives in boundary conditions greatly complicates its implementation. Another set of local boundary conditions with adjustable free parameters was proposed by (Robert W. Clayton and Engquist 1980). Later, (M. Cohen 1980) showed that the paraxial boundary becomes unstable when Poisson’s ratio exceeds \\(0.33\\). A modified version of paraxial boundary called extended-paraxial boundary and its finite element implementation was provided by (M. Cohen and Jennings 1983; M. F. Cohen, Hughes, and Jennings 1981). It was also shown that the performance of extended-paraxial boundary is only slightly superior to the standard-viscous boundary. (Stacey 1988) presented three new paraxial approximations superior to those presented by Clayton and Engquist while avoiding the higher order derivatives. Better finite-difference equations for internal boundaries and corners were also presented in this research.\n(Bayliss and Turkel 1980) presented the sequence of local absorbing boundary conditions in spherical coordinates by employing the asymptotic expansion of the solution of scalar wave equation at large distances. The radiation conditions are given by hierarchy of differential operators \\(B_{m}\\) which annihilate the first \\(m\\) terms in the asymptotic expansion of the solution. The boundary conditions are given by\n\\[\n{B_m}u = \\left[ {\\prod\\limits_{k = 1}^m {\\left( {\\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial t}} + \\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial r}} + \\frac{{2j - 1}}{R}} \\right)} } \\right]u = 0\n\\tag{7.1}\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the radius of the artificial boundary. This higher order local boundary condition, like previous schemes given by other researchers, contains the higher order derivatives which makes their practical implementation near to impossible.\n(Robert L. Higdon 1986) considered the two-dimensional wave equation in a rectangular truncated domain \\(\\Omega\\). In his work scalar wave equation was first discretized in space and time domain using finite difference scheme. Subsequently, some discrete boundary conditions were derived for the artificial boundary. He then presented the analytical boundary condition corresponding to the discrete one. The \\(p\\)-order boundary condition, for a boundary vertical boundary located at some \\(x&gt;0\\), is described by the product type differential operators \\(H_{p}\\)\n\\[\n{H_p}u = \\left[ {\\prod\\limits_{j = 1}^p {\\left( {\\cos {\\theta _j}\\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial t}} + c\\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial x}}} \\right)} } \\right]u = 0\n\\tag{7.2}\\]\nwhere \\(c\\) is some reference wave-speed and \\(\\theta_{j}\\) is the angle of incident and \\(\\left| {{\\theta _j}} \\right| &lt; \\pi /2,\\quad \\,\\forall j = 1, \\cdots ,p\\). In literature \\(H_{p}\\) is know as Higdon-boundary operator, and Eq. [eq-Higdon-BC-1] is called the Higdon absorbing boundary condition (Higdon ABC). The alternatively form of this boundary condition is given by\n\\[\n{H_p}u = \\left[ {\\prod\\limits_{j = 1}^p {\\left( {\\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial t}} + {C_j}\\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial x}}} \\right)} } \\right]u = 0\n\\tag{7.3}\\]\nwhere \\(C_{j}=c/cos\\theta_{j}; \\quad C_{j} \\ge c\\) signify the phase speed in the \\(x\\)-direction.\nHigdon ABC is perfectly absorbing for a plane wave hitting the artificial boundary at one the angles \\(\\pm \\theta_{j}\\) for \\(j=1,\\cdots, p\\) with speed \\(c\\). Therefore, Higdon-boundary will appear absolutely transparent at the discrete angle of incidence \\(\\pm \\theta_{1}, \\cdots, \\pm \\theta_{p}\\). The second order Higdon ABC (i.e. \\(p=2\\) in Equation 7.2) corresponds to the linear space time interpolation of solution at the artificial boundary. Higdon also demonstrated that p-order Engquist-Majda condition is special case of Equation 7.2 with \\(\\theta_{j}=0,\\quad \\forall j=1,\\cdots, p\\) for more general description see (Robert L. Higdon 1986 Propostition 9.1).\nThrough several numerical experiments it was demonstrated that the amount of spurious reflection is not very sensitive to the choice of the \\(\\theta_j\\) (Robert L. Higdon 1987). Therefore, the fact that \\(\\theta_{j}\\) are not known a priori is not a major restriction for the Higdon ABC. Further, Higdon ABC is very general as they are applicable to variety of wave problems including waves in dispersive media (Robert L. Higdon 1994) and stratified media (Robert L. Higdon 1992). Moreover, the condition is exact in the sense that when the order \\(p\\) in Equation 7.2 increases to infinity, it gives a global formulation. Unfortunately, the \\(p\\)-order Higdon ABC will contain \\(p\\)-order space and time derivatives. Therefore, high order conditions are impractical beyond 2nd or 3rd order from the implementation point of view. Finally, it is noteworthy that Higdon ABC is local in space and time.\n(Robert L. Higdon 1990; R. L. Higdon 1991) extended the Higdon ABC for the case of elastic wave propagating in two-dimensional space. In the case of elastic waves Higdon-boundary operator is written by\n\\[\n{H_p}{\\mathbf{u}} = \\left[ {\\prod\\limits_{j = 1}^p {\\left( {{\\beta _j}\\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial t}} + {c_L}\\frac{\\partial }{{\\partial x}}} \\right)} } \\right]{\\mathbf{u}} = 0\n\\tag{7.4}\\]\nwhere \\(c_{L}\\) is phase-velocity of longitudinal plane wave (cf. Equation 5.10) and \\(\\beta_{j}&gt;0,\\forall j\\) resemble to the cosine of angle of incident. The \\(j\\)th operator in Equation 7.4 is perfectly absorbing for P-waves traveling at angle of incidence \\(\\pm {\\cos ^{-1}}{\\beta_{j}}\\) and S-wave traveling at angle of incidence \\(\\pm {\\cos ^{-1}}\\left( {{\\beta_{j}}{c_T}/{c_L}} \\right)\\). If \\(\\beta_{j} \\le 1,\\forall j\\), then Equation 7.4 is oriented mainly to absorb P-waves but also helps to absorb S-waves. If \\(\\beta_j\\)’s are are all near the ratio \\(c_{L}/c_{T}&gt;1\\) then Equation 7.4 is oriented mainly to absorb S-waves but helps absorb P-wave. In addition, Higdon showed that Higdon ABC is stable for all values of the ratio \\(c_{L}/c_{T}\\) while the second order Engquist-Majda boundary conditions is unstable for large value of \\(c_{L}/c_{T}\\).\n(Underwood and Geers 1981) presented a local transmitting boundary condition for a structure embedded in the elastic medium problem. Their method was based on a substructure approach in which to model the effect of infinite domain interaction-horizon was placed at the soil-structure interface. The soil-structure interaction was approximated by first order doubly asymptotic boundary element techniques. The following relation was used for surface force vector \\(\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{f}}^s}} \\right\\}\\) associated with the scattered waves\n\\[\n\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{f}}^s}} \\right\\} = \\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_b^0} \\right]\\left\\{ {\\mathbf{u}} \\right\\} + \\left[ {{\\mathbf{C}}_b^\\infty } \\right]\\left\\{ {\\mathbf{v}} \\right\\}\n\\tag{7.5}\\]\nwhere \\(\\left\\{ {\\mathbf{u}} \\right\\}\\) and \\(\\left\\{ {\\mathbf{v}}\\right\\}\\) is the vector of nodal displacement and velocity, respectively. From Equation 7.5 it can be observed that in high (low frequency) limit the unbounded domain is modelled as an array of dashpots (springs). The boundary stiffness matrix \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_b^0} \\right]\\) is non-symmetric and it couples all the nodes at the interaction-horizon, therefore, this approach is local in time but non-local in space. The method behaves poorly in intermediate range of frequency. Moreover, this approach can only absorb the waves propagating normal to the interaction-horizon.\nLater (John P. Wolf and Song 1995) combined the doubly asymptotic approach of (Underwood and Geers 1981) and Higdon ABC to derive the doubly asymptotic multi-directional (DAMD) ABC. In his approach Equation 7.5 additionally contains the surface force vector \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{Q}}_b^s} \\right\\}\\) which represents the remaining interaction forces. These forces were computed from the second-order Higdon ABC (cf. Equation 7.2) while replacing \\(u\\) with the \\(Q\\). Explicit finite difference scheme was employed to calculate \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{Q}}_b^s} \\right\\}\\) and then used in finite element formulation of the total dynamic system to compute the displacement and velocity field. By numerical examples, they showed that the approach is rigorous for both low and high frequency limit in all preselected angles of incidence. In addition, DAMD-ABC is highly accurate for plane waves at intermediate frequency and at other angles. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it uses explicit finite difference scheme to solve Higdon ABC which obviously makes entire scheme conditionally stable even if one uses unconditionally stable direct time integration scheme for finite element analysis. Therefore, a very small time step must be selected to ensure the overall stability. Of course one can use implicit unconditionally stable schemes but then this will increase the overall computational cost.\nFollowing the Bayliss-Turkel conditions, (T. Hagstrom and Hariharan 1998) derived a sequence of local boundary conditions for isotropic problems (i.e. non-dispersive case). In contrast to previous high-order schemes their conditions avoids the use of higher order derivatives in the normal direction and in the preferred wave propagation direction. This was made possible due to the use of auxiliary functions; the local conditions of arbitrary order are expressed recursively using auxiliary functions. This way practical use of higher order ABC is possible. However, the scheme was only applicable in the case of spherical symmetry and axial symmetry.\n(Collino1993?) presented the first use of high order asymptotic boundary conditions, within finite difference framework, for two-dimensional time-dependent waves in rectangular domain. Corner compatibility conditions were also provided in their formulation. (Dan Givoli 2001) presented a general approach to construct local arbitrary high-order boudary conditions (AHOC) with a symmetric structure and with only low order spatial and/or temporal derivatives. This enables the practical use of ABCs of arbitrarily high order.\nLater, (Dan Givoli and Neta 2003) reformulated the sequence of ABCs proposed by Higdon to obtain the arbitrary high-order local ABCs. This scheme is similar to the one proposed by (T. Hagstrom and Hariharan 1998) only in the sense that it eliminates the higher order derivatives by use of special auxiliary variables. In this case, however, the auxiliary variables are defined by simple recursive relations. Moreover, the formulation was presented in Cartesian coordinates for rectangular domain.\nThe standard (\\(C^{0}\\) continuous) finite element implementation of this scheme was presented in (Dan Givoli, Neta, and Patlashenko 2003) for the case of linear inhomogeneous dispersive wave (Klein-Gordon) equation. It was shown that the scheme is stable even for equal-order nodal interpolation for all the variables. Besides, the computational effort associated with the boundary condition grows only linearly with the order of accuracy.\n(Joolen, Neta, and Givoli 2005) applied the Givoli-Neta boundary conditions for exterior time-dependent wave problems in two-dimensional unbounded domain. They reported long-time instability of the method and suggested that the special compatibility conditions at the corner of rectangular domain should be include in the auxiliary-variable formulation.\nThe corner compatibility conditions for wave equation with artificial boundary conditions were discussed by (Vacus 2005).\nFollowing the work of (Dan Givoli and Neta 2003), (Thomas Hagstrom and Warburton 2004) presented a new auxiliary variable formulation which includes the special corner compatibility conditions. Hangstrom and Warburton conditions can be considered as the symmetrized modification of the Givoli-Neta conditions with enhanced stability characteristics. Their formulation was also based in Cartesian coordinate system with rectangular truncated domain. In the paper they presented a finite difference formulation of their approach. The finite element implementation of Hagstrom-Warburton formulation is presented by (Dan Givoli, Hagstrom, and Patlashenko 2006) for exterior time-dependent wave problems governed by the scalar wave equation.\n(Samii and Lotfi 2012, 2013) implemented the Hagstrom-Warburton ABC for the dam-reservoir interaction problem using finite element methods. (Thomas Hagstrom, Mar-Or, and Givoli 2008) employed the Hagstrom-Warburton ABC for dispersive medium for which the Klein-Gordon wave equation governs. They also extended the boundary conditions to take into account of evanescent modes. (Rabinovich et al. 2011) extended the Hagstrom-Warburton ABC for time dependent elastic wave in unbounded domain and presented a variational formulation for the finite element implementation. However, their scheme suffers from long-time instability. Later, (Baffet et al. 2012) suggested that the cause of this instability may be due to the use of only Higdon-type ABC for elastic wave problem. In their formulation they combined Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer type boundary operator with the Higdon-type operators. This modification leads to the long-time stability of their formulation.\n(Kellezi 2000) developed a cone boundary condition for the vibration problems on the surface of a half-space where the generated waves propagates in an area that increases with depth. This boundary condition can be considered as an extension of the standard viscous boundary condition of (Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer 1969). Physically, cone boundary condition represents a series of dashpots and springs placed in the normal and tangential direction of the truncated boundary. Due to the inclusion of the additional springs, the cone boundary condition approximates the stiffness of the unbounded soil domain and therefore it eliminates the permanent movement which occurs with the viscous boundary condition at low frequencies (Kontoe, Zdravkovic, and Potts 2009). However, a drawback of the cone boundary is that the stiffness coefficients of the springs depend on the distance of the boundary from the source of excitation. Therefore, its use is restricted to problems with surface excitations where the distance of the boundary from the source is known.\n(Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer 1969) first proposed the artificial boundary condition for elastic waves (henceforth known as LK-ABC). In this section LK-ABC is first derived for the case of one-dimensional longitudinal wave (P-wave) impinging normally at the boundary, then the condition is derived for the case of vertically propagating SV-wave again impinging normally at the boundary. Finally, the LK-condition is derived for plane wave impinging at some angle \\(\\theta\\) at the artificial boundary.",

Initial conditions and boundary conditions are given by Equation 7.7 and Equation 7.8.\n\\[\n{u_1}\\left( {{x_1},0} \\right) = 0;\\quad \\,{v_1}\\left( {{x_1},0} \\right) = 0\n\\tag{7.7}\\]\n\\[\n{\\sigma _{11}}\\left( {0,t} \\right) =  - p\\left( t \\right)\n\\qquad  p(t)=0 \\quad \\textit{for} \\quad t&lt;0\n\\tag{7.8}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Illustration of (A) a half-space subjected to uniform pressure, (B) truncation of unbounded domain by introducing artificial boundary to obtain finite computational domain, (C) satisfying radiation condition by placing series of dashpots along the artificial boundary\n\n\n\nThe general form of solution to the wave equation Equation 7.6 is given by\n\\[\n{u_1}\\left( {{x_1},t} \\right) = f\\left( {t - \\frac{{{x_1}}}{{{c_L}}}} \\right) + g\\left( {t + \\frac{{{x_1}}}{{{c_L}}}} \\right)\n\\] \nwhere \\(f(\\cdot)\\) and \\(g(\\cdot)\\) denote the wave traveling positive and negative \\(x_{1}\\)-direction, respectively. Obviously, in the present case no wave will travel in the negative \\(x_{1}\\)-direction (see Achenbach 2012, vol. 16, chap. 2), hence\n\\[\n{u_1}\\left( {{x_1},t} \\right) = f\\left( {t - \\frac{{{x_1}}}{{{c_L}}}} \\right)\n\\tag{7.9}\\]\nEmploying Equation 5.2 and Equation 7.9 the non-trivial components of stress tensor become\n\\[\n\\sigma_{11}(x_{1},t) =  - \\frac{{\\left( {\\lambda  + 2\\mu } \\right)}}{{{c_L}}}{f^{'}}\\left( {t - \\frac{x_{1}}{{{c_L}}}} \\right) = -\\rho {c_L}{f^{'}}\\left( {t - \\frac{x_{1}}{{{c_L}}}} \\right)\n\\tag{7.10}\\]\n\\[\n{\\sigma _{22}}(x_{1},t) = {\\sigma _{33}} =  - \\frac{\\lambda }{{{c_L}}}{f^{'}}\\left( {t - \\frac{x_{1}}{{{c_L}}}} \\right)\n\\tag{7.11}\\]\nFuther, the velocity is given by\n\\[\n{v_1}\\left( {{x_1},t} \\right) = {f^{'}}\\left( {t - \\frac{x_{1}}{{{c_L}}}} \\right)\n\\tag{7.12}\\]\nNoting Equation 7.10 and Equation 7.12 we can obtain the following relation between normal stress \\(\\sigma_{11}\\) and normal velocity \\(v_{1}\\) (here space, time coordinates are omitted for clarity of expressions).\n\\[\n{\\sigma _{11}} =  - \\rho {c_L}{v_1}\n\\tag{7.13}\\]\nEquation 7.13 is the LK boundary condition for the case of one-dimensional P-wave propagation. In this relation the term \\(\\rho c_{L}\\) is called the mechanical impedance of the medium. Mechanical impedance is the property of the medium which measures the stress that is required to generate the motion of particles (Achenbach 2012). In simple terms, Equation 7.13 signifies the amount of stress required to completely transfer the motion (linear momentum and energy) of a plane to the next plane. Consequently, the wave will be reflected (partially or completely) if the stress does not satisfy the above relation. Further, Equation 7.13 is a characteristic equation of a dashpot with damping coefficient equal to the mechanical impedance. Therefore, it is possible to work with the finite computational domain by introducing the artificial boundary with boundary condition given by Equation 7.13. In this way unbounded domain can be replaced by a series of dashpot normal to artificial boundary as depicted in Figure 7.3 c.",

It can be observed that the choice of \\(a=b=1.0\\) provides highly efficient LK-ABC as it gives the maximum absorption. The absorption cannot be made perfect over the whole rage of incident angles by any choice of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). This is further confirmed by Fig. 12 which present the variation of amplitudes with the angle of incidence at \\(a=b=1.0\\) and Poisson’s ratio=0.25. Further, nearly perfect absorption is attained in the range \\(0&lt;\\theta&lt;60{}^{\\circ{}}\\) for \\(a=b=1\\). (Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer 1969) showed that the LK-ABC for \\(a=b=1\\) is \\(98.5\\) % effective in absorbing the impinging P-waves. Besides, Fig. 11 shows that LK-ABC is almost insensitive to the value of Poisson’s ratio.",

In all cases the performance of LK-ABC decreases significantly when the angle of incidence becomes greater than the critical angle. It indicates that LK-ABC are not very efficient for the absorbing the surface waves. Further, Figure 7.10 suggests that the performance of LK-ABC is nearly independent of the Poisson’s ratio. Finally, it can be concluded that the performance of LK-ABC mainly depends upon the angle of incidence. In particular, the LK-ABC performs reasonably well when the angle of incidence is in the range \\(0&lt;\\theta_{0}&lt;60{}^{\\circ{}}\\) for \\(a=b=1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: Effect of parameters \\(a,b\\) on energy ratio for incident S-wave (Poisson’s ratio=\\(0.25\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: Effect of Poisson’s ratio (\\(\\nu\\)) on energy ratio for incident S-wave (\\(a=b=1.0\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.11: Variation of real and imaginary part of amplitude with angle of incidence for incident S-wave (Poisson’s ratio=\\(0.25\\), \\(a=b=1.0\\))",

    "text": "7.8 Free field response and effective seismic input\nWhen the source of excitation is present inside the truncated computation domain, as discussed in previous section, the mechanical disturbance generates inside the domain and propagates towards the infinity through the artificial boundaries. In such cases, consequently, the dynamic response of structure does not depend upon the response of exterior unbounded domain. Accordingly, the prescribed boundary condition on artificial boundary should satisfy the radiation damping with significant accuracy in order to simulate this one-way interaction.\nIn practical cases, such as earthquake excitation, blast engineering, vibrations due to high-speed railways and road-traffic among others, the source of dynamic loading may be present outside of computational domain. Consequently, the response of structure is coupled with the dynamic response of the unbounded domain. It is clear that, irrespective of the type of ABC employed to truncate the domain, the response of unbounded domain with the structure present will differ significantly from that of the free field ground motion (Bielak and Christiano 1984). Thereby, to correctly model the dynamic SSI one has to ensure not only the absorption of the outgoing scattered wave motion using appropriate ABC but also the input of the free field ground motion into the numerical model. Unfortunately, the seismic excitation cannot be specified directly at the artificial boundaries as this would render any absorbing boundary ineffective (Løkke and Chopra 2017). Thus it is necessary to prescribe the seismic excitation in the form of effective generalized earthquake forces.\nBielak and his coworkers (Bielak and Christiano 1984; Bielak et al. 2003; Yoshimura et al. 2003; Cremonini, Christiano, and Bielak 1988) presented a two step procedure for an effective seismic input while treating the dynamic SSI as a scattering problem. In first step, effective seismic forces were expressed in terms of free-field tractions and displacements in unperturbed soil-medium. In second step, the effective forces are applied as input over the domain slightly bigger to contain both structure and absorbing boundary. Their method seems to be very efficient for reducing the size of computation domain as it requires to store free-field displacements only in a single layer of elements next to the soil-structure interface. Clearly, their method has the advantage of eliminating the need to transmit seismic excitation through the artificial boundary into the region of interest, in this way absorbing boundary need to only absorb the outgoing waves. However, implementation of such schemes requires a significant change in the existing finite element programs.\nAlternatively, the LK-ABC can be engineered to allow sesimic excitation to enter the computation domain. Such procedures are very simple, quite effective and require little changes in the existing computer programs (Miura and Okinaka 1989; Zienkiewicz, Bicanic, and Shen 1989; Saouma et al. 2011; Løkke and Chopra 2017; Nielsen 2006; Zhang et al. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.12: Illustration of soil-structure interaction as a scattering problem\n\n\n\nFigure 7.12 illustrates the situation where a structure (possibly with nonlinear material behaviour) embedded inside a linear elastic half-space is subjected to the earthquake excitation. The auxiliary state of the system is defined by elastic-half space without the structure (see Figure 7.12 b). The term free field response will used for the dynamic response of the auxiliary state under seismic loading.\nAs described earlier in this chapter, once the wave reaches at the free surface (and/or interface between two soil layers) reflection will occur. Hence, the free field variables (\\(\\mathbf{u}_{0}, \\mathbf{v}_{0}, \\sigma_{0}\\)) contains the contribution due to both incoming and reflected waves. If some structure is embedded inside the half-space then it will perturbed the free-field response. The degree of perturbation, of course, depends upon the dynamic response of the structure itself. Clearly, the dynamic SSI can be scrutinized from the point of view of scattering problem (Bielak and Christiano 1984; Bielak et al. 2003; Yoshimura et al. 2003; Cremonini, Christiano, and Bielak 1988; Løkke and Chopra 2017; Basu and Chopra 2004). In the following subsection this concept will be utilized to modify the viscous boundary condition, Equation 7.19 and Equation 7.20, so that LK ABC can absorb the outgoing scattered waves while allowing the energy inflow from the outer free fields.",

    "text": "7.9 Viscous boundary condition for free field input\nLet \\(\\Omega_{0}\\) be some fictitious finite domain of the auxiliary state which will contain the structure in the future (see Figure 7.12). Let \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\) denotes that part of the boundary of \\(\\Omega_{0}\\) which will eventually coincide with the absorbing boundaries. Let \\(\\mathbf{u}_{0}, \\mathbf{v}_{0}, \\sigma_{0}\\) be the free field displacement, velocity and stress, respectively. Let \\(\\Omega_{\\infty}^{+}\\) be the regular unbounded domain exterior to the \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\). One should keep in mind that that the auxiliary state does not correspond to any physical state but is introduced to formulate the appropriate absorbing boundary condition. Figure 7.12 c depicts the actual computation domain \\(\\Omega\\) separated from the \\(\\Omega_{\\infty}^{+}\\) through the viscous boundary \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\). \\(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}, \\sigma\\) denote the total displacement, total velocity and total stress, respectively, inside the computation domain \\(\\Omega\\). On contrary, the variables \\({\\mathbf{\\tilde u}},{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}},\\tilde \\sigma\\) represent the scattered motion in the exterior unbounded domain \\(\\Omega_{\\infty}^{+}\\). Further, the total displacement and velocity can be decomposed in terms of scattered solution and free-field solution (Bielak and Christiano 1984).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n{\\mathbf{u}} &= {\\mathbf{\\tilde u}} + {{\\mathbf{u}}_0}\n&{\\mathbf{v}} &= {\\mathbf{\\tilde v}} + {{\\mathbf{v}}_0}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.40}\\]\nNoting the fact that the material in the vicinity of the absorbing boundary behaves linearly, the stress at the boundary can be written as\n\\[\n\\sigma\\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\tilde \\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf{n} + \\sigma_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\quad \\texttt{on} \\quad \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\n\\tag{7.41}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde{\\sigma}\\) denotes the stress corresponding to \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is the unit outward normal to \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\).\nTo simulate the effect of unbounded domain viscous boundary should absorb the outgoing scattered waves, accordingly Equation 7.19 and Equation 7.20 becomes\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\sigma}_{n}= -a \\rho c_{L} \\tilde{v}_{n}\n\\tag{7.42}\\]\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\tau}= -b \\rho c_{T} \\tilde{v}_{s}\n\\tag{7.43}\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde{\\sigma}_{n}\\) and \\(\\tilde{\\tau}\\) are the normal and tangential boundary traction and \\(\\tilde{v}_{n}, \\tilde{v}_{s}\\) are the normal and tangential scattered velocity components. Finally, using Equation 7.40 and Equation 7.41 in the above two equation\n\\[\n{\\sigma _n} =  - a\\rho {c_L}{v_n} + a\\rho {c_L}{\\left( {{v_0}} \\right)_n} + {\\left( {{\\sigma _0}} \\right)_n}\n\\tag{7.44}\\]\n\\[\n\\tau  =  - b\\rho {c_T}{v_s} + b\\rho {c_T}{\\left( {{v_0}} \\right)_s} + {\\tau _0}\n\\tag{7.45}\\]\nThe presence of last two terms in Equation 7.44 and Equation 7.45 will allow the energy to flow from the exterior domain \\(\\Omega_{\\infty}^{+}\\) into the computation domain \\(\\Omega_{0}\\) through the viscous boundaries \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\). At this point it is critical to note that the modified viscous boundary requires information of the free field response (\\(\\mathbf{u}_{0}, \\mathbf{v}_{0}\\)) only at the absorbing boundary.",

    "section": "7.10 Effective seismic input",
    "text": "7.10 Effective seismic input\nIn order to compute the effective seismic input using Equation 7.44 and Equation 7.45 it is necessary to determine the free field motion (\\(\\mathbf{u}_{0}, \\mathbf{v}_{0}\\)). There are various methodologies to compute \\(\\mathbf{u}_{0}\\). For example, if the informations about the rupture characteristics of earthquake faults, the geological material between the earthquake source and the site, and local site conditions is available then one can conduct a large-scale 3D simulation of seismic wave propagation from an earthquake source to region near the structure (Bao et al. 1998). This level of details, however, is rarely available, therefore such simulation are impractical at present.\nOne of the practical ways, is to define the ground motion at the some control point based on a design spectrum. Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, artificially generated motions, recorded ground motions, among other techniques can be used to generate earthquake motions. Further, these motions can be scaled and modified to match the target spectrum in some sense (Hariri-Ardebili, Seyed-Kolbadi, and Kianoush 2016; Zhang et al. 2003). Furthermore, under the assumption of vertically propagating body waves and homogeneous or layered soil stratum, the free-field motion \\(\\mathbf{u}_{0}\\) at the boundary \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\) can be obtained by one-dimensional deconvolution of the ground motion at the control point (Schnabel 1972; Hashash 2009). In principle, the motion of every nodal point on \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\) can computed usig the the deconvolution analysis, but in practice this approach may become a computational burden for a large number of elevations.\nThe above problem related to the deconvolution technique can be avoided under the condition that the body waves (P-wave and S-wave) due to the seismic excitation propagates in the vertical direction in an isotropic, homogeneous, elastic half space. To derive the expression for effective seismic input consider a vertically propagating SV-wave as described in the previous Section. Let absorbing boundary be placed at \\(x_{2}=0\\) where the seismic wave is entering the system. Total displacement of the particle will be\n\\[\n{u_1}\\left( {{x_2},t} \\right) = f\\left( {t - \\frac{{{x_2}}}{{{c_T}}}} \\right) + g\\left( {t + \\frac{{{x_2}}}{{{c_T}}}} \\right)\n\\tag{7.46}\\]\nand the velocity\n\\[\n{v_1}\\left( {{x_2},t} \\right) = {f^{'}}\\left( {t - \\frac{{{x_2}}}{{{c_T}}}} \\right) + {g^{'}}\\left( {t + \\frac{{{x_2}}}{{{c_T}}}} \\right)\n\\tag{7.47}\\]\nor\n\\[\n{v_1} = v_1^I + v_1^R\n\\tag{7.48}\\]\nwhere \\(v_1^I=f^{'}(\\cdot)\\) and \\(v_1^R=g^{'}(\\cdot)\\) denote incoming and outgoing velocity wave. Noting that \\(\\sigma_{12}\\) is the only non-zero stress component and \\(\\mathbf{n}=(0,-1)^{T}\\) at the boundary \\(x_{2}=0\\), the tangential boundary traction becomes\n\\[\n\\tau  =  - {\\sigma _{12}} =  - \\rho {c_T}\\left( { - v_1^I + v_1^R} \\right)\n\\tag{7.49}\\]\nusing Equation 7.48 in Equation 7.49\n\\[\n\\tau  =  - \\rho {c_T}{v_1} + \\rho {c_T}2v_1^I\n\\tag{7.50}\\]\nadopting \\(v_{s}^{I}=v_{1}^{I}\\) and \\(v_{s}=v_{1}\\) for the component of incoming and total velocity tangential to the boundary \\(x_{2}=0\\), respectively.\n\\[\n\\tau  =  - \\rho {c_T}{v_s} + \\rho {c_T}2v_s^I\n\\tag{7.51}\\]\nFollowing the same procedure for the vertically propagating P-wave one can obtain\n\\[\n{\\sigma _n} =  - \\rho {c_L}{v_n} + \\rho {c_L}2v_n^I\n\\tag{7.52}\\]\nComparing Equation 7.51 with Equation 7.45 and Equation 7.52 with Equation 7.44 it can be seen that under the assumption of vertically propagating body waves in an isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic-half space the equivalent forces due to seismic motion on the bottom boundary can be described completely in terms of the incoming velocity at \\(x_{2}=0\\). In this way the incoming velocity at the bottom can be computed through the deconvolution of the ground motion at the control point. Furthermore, from Equation 7.51 and Equation 7.52 it is evident that the incident velocity \\(v^{I}\\) is half of the total velocity at the free surface4.",

The Finite Element Method (FEM) has been undoubtedly accepted as the most popular, reliable, and successful numerical tool for simulating soil dynamics problems (Anandarajah 1993; Khoshnoudian and Shahrour 2002; Kimura and Zhang 2000; Kuwano et al. 1991; Q.

Further, environmental impact and safety assessments of the ground vibrations generated by high-speed trains (Ditzel, Herman, and HÖLSCHER 2001; Krylov 1996; Takemiya 2003) and road traffic (Chua, Balendra, and Lo 1992; Clemente and Rinaldis 1998; Clouteau, Degrande, and Lombaert 2001; Maeda et al. 1998) close to the residential areas, hospitals, and high-tech industries are of paramount importance. FEM has also been extensively used for investigating the level of vibrations and schemes to reduce them (Hung, Kuo, and Yang 2001; Shen Haw Ju 2007; Shen-Haw Ju 2009; Shen-Haw Ju et al. 2006; Shen-Haw Ju and Lin 2004). Moreover, in the field of transportation engineering, nondestructive deflection testing, with the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD), has become increasingly popular for monitoring the structural health of flexible pavement systems over time Chai, Staden, and Loo (2014; Elbagalati et al. 2018; Maina et al. 2000). In FWD testing, the recorded time histories of surface deflections are used to back-calculate the moduli of pavement layers by employing parameter-identification techniques (Goktepe, Agar, and Lav 2006). Recently, FEM has been employed extensively to simulate FWD testing under realistic conditions and to predict the response of pavement systems brought about by impulsive loading (Loizos and Scarpas 2005; Nazarian and Boddapati 1995; Picoux, El Ayadi, and Petit 2009).\nIn the preceding discussion, the most extended approach for solving elastodynamics problems was based on a semi-discretized FEM formulation. In this approach, FEM is first applied to the spatial domain leading to a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) in the time domain. Subsequently, direct time integration schemes, based on the finite difference method, are employed to solve the resulting system of ODEs. In general, the errors in the finite element simulations of soil-dynamics problems are partially due to the space-time discretization and to the uncertainties involved in the material constitutive relationship and the material parameters. Numerical errors can be reduced by adopting high-order accurate time solvers within FEM framework. Unconditionally stable methods, such as the Newmark-beta method (Newmark 1959), the HHT-\\(\\alpha\\) method (Hilber, Hughes, and Taylor 1977), the Houbolt method (Houbolt 1950), and the Wilson-\\(\\theta\\) method (Bathe and Wilson 1976), are the most often used dynamic solvers. However, these methods are only second-order accurate. Furthermore, Dahlquist’s theorem says that a single-step unconditionally stable time-integration algorithm can be at most second-order accurate (Dahlquist 1963). High-order accurate time-integration schemes based on finite difference schemes can be employed. However, these schemes are generally conditionally stable and require very small time steps for stability (Hughes 1983). The requirement of small time steps increases the overall computational cost of large-scale simulations. Therefore, there is still a need for dynamic solvers which are high-order accurate and unconditionally stable, such that large time steps can be used to reduce the computational cost while maintaining the accuracy of the solutions. The aim of this thesis is to devise such a scheme.\nTo achieve high-order accuracy combined with stability, an alternative strategy called the Space-Time Finite Element Method (ST/FEM) was proposed in the past; it is still being actively researched. The concept of finite elements in the time domain was first exploited independently in Argyris and Scharpf (1969) and Fried (1969) using Hamilton’s principle. Unfortunately, these formulations were found to be inconsistent, and even inaccurate in some cases, due to the vanishing variation in the displacement at the end points of the time interval. Soon after, Cecil D. Bailey (1975; C. D. Bailey 1980; C. Bailey 1982) and Simkins (1981) established that instead of Hamilton’s principle, Hamilton’s law of varying action, HLVA, should be used as the starting point for the time-finite element formulations, as it includes the initial conditions implicitly. However, for quite some time, researchers misinterpreted the so-called trailing terms of HLVA, and believed that both the displacement field and the velocity field should be continuous in time (M. Borri and Mantegazzat 1985). Due to this misconception, many studies adopted Hermite cubic polynomials as the lowest order of interpolation functions for the displacement field (Menahem Baruch and Riff 1982; M. Baruch and Riff 1984; Gellert 1978; Geradin 1974; Howard and Penny 1978; Riff and Baruch 1984; Simkins 1981; Sorek and Blech 1982). Later, Borri and his colleagues (Borri 1986; Borri et al. 1985; M. Borri and Mantegazzat 1985) showed that the need to use Hermite polynomials can be avoided by employing Hamilton’s weak principle (HWP) in which approximating functions should ensure the continuity of only the displacement field (i.e., \\(C0\\) continuity in time), and not that of any of its time-derivatives. More recently, unconditionally stable time-finite element formulations have been derived using the two-field form of HWP instead of the primal form (Aharoni and Bar-Yoseph 1992; Borri, Mello, and Atluri 1990, 1991; Borri and Bottasso 1993; Mello, Borri, and Atluri 1990; Ruge 1996). For a comprehensive overview and recent advances in the time-finite element formulations based on Hamilton’s law, readers are referred to Tamma et al. (2011).\nAnother approach towards development of the ST/FEM is by weighted residual techniques, such as the continuous Galerkin method (C. Bajer and Bohatier 1995; C. I. Bajer 1987), the discontinuous Galerkin method (Hughes and Hulbert 1988), and the Petrov-Galerkin method (T. Fung and Leung 1996; T. C. Fung 1999), while working directly with the differential equations rather than a variational principle. Moreover, ST/FEM derived from the time-discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) method led to the unconditionally stable and high-order accurate ODE solvers (Delfour, Hager, and Trochu 1981; Johnson and Pitkäranta 1986; Lasaint and Raviart 1974). The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method was first developed for the neutron-transport equation Lasaint and Raviart (1974; Reed and Hill 1973). Soon after, the TDG method was introduced by Jamet (Bonnerot and Jamet 1979; Jamet 1978) for solving the parabolic differential equation with the time- dependent spatial domain. Almost a decade afterwards, Hughes and Hulbert presented the time-discontinuous Galerkin space-time FEM (TDG/ST/FEM) for the fields of elastodynamics and structural dynamics (Hughes and Hulbert 1988). In this paper, two general formulations of TDG/ST/FEM were provided: (i) the single-field formulation, in which the displacement field is the primary unknown, and (ii) the two-field formulation, in which both the displacement field and the velocity field are treated as the primary unknowns. In a latter approach, the trial functions for both fields were continuous in space and discontinuous in time, whereas the test functions were continuous in both space and time. In the two-field formulation, the displacement-velocity compatibility condition and the continuity of both unknown fields in time were satisfied in a weak sense by using some inner products. This is the key element allowing for the generalization of TDG/ST/FEM developed for first order hyperbolic equations to the second order hyperbolic equations (Hughes and Hulbert 1988). However, the main disadvantage of the two-field formulation is that it leads to larger systems of coupled equations than formulations derived from direct integration schemes. To overcome this difficulty, various efficient iterative predictor-multi-corrector algorithms have been suggested by X. Li and Wiberg (1998; Mancuso and Ubertini 2003, 2006; Chien and Wu 2000), among others. Details on the numerical characteristics of two-field formulations, such as stability, the order of accuracy, and algorithmic damping, have been discussed elsewhere (Fan, Fung, and Sheng 1997; T. Fung and Leung 1996; Hulbert 1992).\nAt present, time-discontinuous Galerkin approach have been well studied for the problems involving first order time derivatives. In the field of computational fluid dynamics, this approach have been used for problems involving the moving and free boundaries (Bazilevs, Takizawa, and Tezduyar 2013). In TDG/ST/FEM, shape-functions are usually defined on the space-time domain. Therefore, such method may provide a unified framework for using the Lagrangian mesh, Eulerian mesh, and Arbitrary moving mesh. In addition, for problems involving the second-order time derivatives TDG/ST/FEM facilitates the weak-enforcement of initial conditions through jump-discontinuity in time. In this way, TDG/ST/FEM provides a general framework for arbitrary high order accurate, unconditionally stable time integration algorithms. We believe that these characteristics of TDG/ST/FEM may have great potential for solving the problems of large-deformation dynamic problems.\nAccordingly, in this chapter, a velocity-based single-field ST/FEM is developed within a TDG framework. Hereafter, the term v-ST/FEM will be used to denote the proposed method. In v-ST/FEM, velocity is the primary unknowns which is discontinuous in time and continuous in space. The displacement field is obtained by time integration of the velocity field in a post-processing step. The advantage of v-ST/FEM is that it involves less number of unknowns–unlike other ST/FEM–which makes v-ST/FEM applicable to the large-scale practical problems at relatively low computation cost.\n\n\n\n\nAharoni, D., and P.

In latter case, computation of displacement field can be avoided. In the realm of small strain theory, however, these two techniques of stress recovery are equivalent, and the stress field in a space-time slab takes the form\n\\[\n{\\sigma_{ij}}\\left({{\\mathbf{x}},t}\\right)={\\sigma_{ij}}\\left({{\\mathbf{x}},{t_{n}}}\\right)+{C_{ijkl}}{\\psi_{kl}}\\left({{\\mathbf{v}},t}\\right),\\qquad\\forall\\left({{\\mathbf{x}},t}\\right)\\in{Q_{n}},\\forall v\\in S_{v}^{h}\n\\tag{9.19}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n{\\psi_{ij}}\\left({{\\mathbf{v}},t}\\right)=\\int_{{t_{n}}}^{t}{\\frac{{\\partial{v_{i}}}}{{\\partial{x_{j}}}}d\\tau,}\\qquad\\forall t\\in{I_{n}},\\forall{\\mathbf{v}}\\in S_{v}^{h}\n\\tag{9.20}\\]\nSubsequently, by substituting the expression for the stress given in Equation 9.19 into the weak-form, Eq.

This approach usually yields a large system of linear equations which in turn increases the computation cost. In this case, special procedures are required to reduce the size of the problem. Such procedures are mainly based on the predictor-multicorrector schemes (Bonelli, Bursi, and Mancuso 2002; Bonelli and Bursi 2003; Mancuso and Ubertini 2003; Kunthong and Thompson 2005).\n\n\nIn v-ST/FEM, velocity field is the primary unknown, therefore, the resultant system of linear equations will be significantly smaller than the one in case of two-field TDG/ST/FEM. Accordingly, the computation cost of v-ST/FEM is lower than the two-field TDG/ST/FEM, however, the cost is still higher than the classical semi-discrete schemes.",

The governing equations of the problem are given by Equation 9.5 – Equation 9.9.\nFurther, it is assumed that the elastic media is subjected to the periodic boundary conditions with no external body force (i.e., \\(b_i=0\\) in Equation 9.5.

The analytical solutions for displacement and velocity can be given by (Achenbach 2012):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    {\\mathbf{u}}\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},t} \\right) &= {{\\mathbf{d}}_0}\\cos \\left[ {k\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot {\\mathbf{\\hat r}} - {c_p}t} \\right)} \\right]&\n    {\\mathbf{v}}\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},t} \\right) = {c_p}k{{\\mathbf{d}}_0}\\sin \\left[ {k\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}} \\cdot {\\mathbf{\\hat r}} - {c_p}t} \\right)} \\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\tag{9.43}\\]\nwhere\n\\[{c_p} = \\sqrt {\\frac{{\\lambda  + 2\\mu }}{\\rho }}\\]\nis the speed of the P-wave.\nThe values of constants and the parameters used for solving the problem are given below.

In Figure 9.4, the L2 norm of the errors in the displacement and velocity fields at time \\(t=1.0\\) sec are given in relation to mesh spacing parameter \\(h\\). Based on the convergence results, it can be stated that the v-ST/FEM formulation is nearly second-order accurate in the space for both Quad4 and Tria3 elements. In Figure 9.4, it is observed that the error for the triangular spatial mesh (Tria3) is less than that of the quadrilateral spatial element (Quad4) for the same mesh spacing. This can be attributed to the perfect alignment of the diagonal of the triangular elements with the characteristic lines of the wave propagation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: (a) Exact displacement (x-component) waveforms, (b) displacement (x-component) waveforms obtained by using the v-ST/FEM, (c) exact velocity (x-component) waveforms, (d) velocity (x-component) waveforms obtained by using the v-ST/FEM.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the convergence of the solutions (displacement and velocity) in the time domain is illustrated in Figure 9.5. It can be seen that both displacement and velocity fields computed by the present method are third order accurate in time. Note that the results presented in Figure 9.5 are consistent with Equation 3.69.\nFigure 9.6 illustrates the spatial variation of the displacement and velocity fields obtained by v-ST/FEM. The results are obtained at time \\(t=35\\) seconds with linear triangular mesh of size \\(h=0.25\\) and uniform time-step of size \\(\\Delta t = 0.1\\) sec. The results advocate the ability of v-ST/FEM to maintain the high-order accuracy of the long-term solutions, especially the displacement and velocity waveforms. This can be attributed to the very low numerical dissipation and dispersion characteristics of the present method (see also Figure 3.11 and Figure 3.12). To further emphasize the accuracy of the long-term solutions, the time histories of the computed displacement and velocity at the midpoint P1 (see Figure 9.3) and the corresponding relative errors are presented in Figure 9.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Temporal variation of the (a) displacement, (b) relative error in displacement, (c) velocity, and (d) relative error in velocity, at the midpoint P1 computed by using v-ST/FEM.",

    "text": "9.7 Impulsive response of a fixed-free pile\nIn this section, we consider a pile of length \\(L=50\\) m with a unit cross-section area having one fixed end and one end loaded by an axial impulsive force given by a step function, as shown in Fig. 6. The mass density \\(\\rho\\) is \\(2500.0\\) \\(kg/m^3\\) and the Young’s modulus \\(E\\) is \\(1.0\\times 10^{10}\\) \\(N/m^2\\). The magnitude of the implusive force is \\(1.0 \\times 10^6\\) \\(N\\). Under these circumstances, the analytical solutions for the stress and velocity fields are discontinuous in the spatial domain and given by the step functions. Furthermore, the displacements are given by the piecewise continuous linear functions (Cormeau 1991; Li and Wiberg 1998; Verruijt 2009).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Geometry, boundary conditions, and impulse loading for fixed-free pile problem.\n\n\n\nTo solve the problem by using v-ST/FEM, uniform linear spatial elements of size \\(h=0.1m\\) and a uniform time-step size \\(\\Delta t = 10^{-4}\\) sec have been adopted for discretizing the space and time domain, respectively. To assess the performance of the present method, the problem is also solved with semi-discretized FEM techniques using the same mesh parameters. In the latter case, the trapezoidal rule and the HHT-\\(\\alpha\\) method (with \\(\\alpha=-1/3\\)) have been used as the time-stepping algorithms. The results of the stress field, velocity field, and displacement field obtained by different schemes are compared in Figure 9.9, Figure 9.10, and Figure 9.11, respectively.\nIt is observed that the solutions for the stress and velocity fields obtained by the semi-discrete algorithms contain severe oscillations. Even worse, no improvement whatsoever is obtained when refining the mesh spacing or the time-step size. Further, in the case of the Newmark-beta method, these oscillations are present in the whole spatial domain; and thus, the accuracy of the stress and velocity fields deteriorate over time (see Figure 9.9 and Figure 9.10). The poor performance with the Newmark-beta method is due to the absence of algorithmic damping, as discussed in previous sections. The HHT-\\(\\alpha\\) method improves the solutions by attenuating higher frequencies; however, the results are not satisfactory for the selected time-step size as the oscillations are still present. It is remarkable that v-ST/FEM completely localizes the oscillations in the stress and velocity fields near the point of discontinuity and yields very accurate solutions. The localization phenomenon can be attributed to the presence of jump discontinuity in the velocity field. The jump in the velocity field adds artificial viscous damping to the system, subsequently, increasing the accuracy and stabilizing the solutions (Hulbert and Hughes 1990; Johnson 1993). Furthermore, the presence of overshooting and undershooting around the point of discontinuity is related to the famous Gibbs phenomenon in the Fourier analysis (Olver 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: Stress field computed by employing the Newmark-beta method (First column), HHT-\\(\\alpha\\) (Second column), and v-ST/FEM (Third column) at various timesteps with linear spatial elements.

    "text": "9.8 Dynamic plate load test (DPLT)\nIn this section, an attempt is made to validate v-ST/FEM by simulating the dynamic plate loading test (DPLT) using a light falling weight deflectometer (LFWD). DPLT using LFWD is a non-destructive technique for a quick assessment of the field compaction quality. In DPLT, a rigid circular loading plate of radius \\(0.15\\) m is placed on the soil surface and subjected to an impulse load generated by the falling weight from a specified height onto the plate. Subsequently, the induced soil movements are recorded and the dynamic resilience modulus of the tested material is computed by some empirical relations. A complete description of the test can be found elsewhere (Adam et al. 2009; Tawfik and El-Mossallamy 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.12: Geometry, boundary conditions and spatial mesh adopted for simulating DPLT using v-ST/FEM.\n\n\n\nIn the present study, DPLT is simulated by a two-dimensional axisymmetric v-ST/FEM model, where the center of the loading plate is positioned along the axis of symmetry. The geometry, boundary conditions, and spatial mesh of the finite element model are depicted in Figure 9.12. There are \\(5201\\) linear triangular elements (Tria3) and \\(2688\\) nodes present in the spatial mesh. The impulse load due to the falling weight is modeled by using an equivalent uniform vertical stress pulse of amplitude \\(100\\) kPa and a time duration of \\(20\\) ms (Adam et al. 2009). The stress pulse \\(h(t)\\) acting on the loading plate is defined by a half sine wave as:\n\\[\nh(t)=-10^{5} \\sin(50 \\pi t) \\, \\text{N/m}{}^2\n\\]\nThe total simulation time \\(T\\) is set to \\(30\\) ms, and the linear time elements of size \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) ms have been adopted for discretizing the time domain. Subsequently, the results computed by the proposed method are compared with the two DPLT studies available in the literature. The first study is denoted as S1 where the in-situ LFWD test was conducted by (Tawfik and El-Mossallamy 2017), and the second study is denoted by S2 in which the numerical investigation was conducted by (Adam et al. 2009) using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). In these studies (i.e., S1 and S2), the soils have different values for Young’s modulus \\(E\\) and common values for Poisson’s ratio \\(\\nu\\) and mass density \\(\\rho\\), as shown in Table 9.1.\n\n\n\nTable 9.1: List of elastic material parameters, and the results of maximum plate deflection and maximum soil-plate normal contact stress obtained by different schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElastic parameters\nMethod\n\\(d_{max}\\)\n\\(p_{max}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(E=65\\) Mpa\nv-ST/FEM\n\\(0.33\\) mm\n\\(90.0\\) kPa\n\n\n\\(\\nu = 0.212\\)\nIn-situ study (S1)\n\\(0.35\\) mm\n\\(100\\) kPa\n\n\n\\(\\rho = 2000\\) \\(kg/m^3\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(E=32\\) Mpa\nv-ST/FEM\n\\(0.67\\) mm\n\\(90.0\\) kPa\n\n\n\\(\\nu = 0.212\\)\nBEM study (S2)\n\\(0.65\\) mm\n\\(93.1\\) kPa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the time histories of the vertical displacement and the velocity of the loading plate, and the soil-plate contact stress are plotted in Figure 9.13.

In the present study, the maximum soil-plate normal contact stress \\(p_{max}\\) is about \\(90\\) kPa; which lower than the values reported in studies S1 and S2 (see Table 9.1).

    "text": "10.1 Introduction\nThe seismic behaviour of a structure is highly influenced not only by the dynamic response of the superstructure, but also by the response of the underlying soil (Kausel 2010). The problem of dynamic soil-structure interaction (SSI) had already been studied as early as 1935 in Japan by Katsutada Sezawa and Kiyoshi Kanai who published a truly remarkable, pioneering paper on the subject (Sezawa and Kanai 1935d, 1935a, 1935c, 1935b). Analytical solutions for the problem of dynamic interaction between superstructure (with regular shaped foundation) and underlying isotropic, homogenous, linear elastic half-space have been presented by many researchers (Arnold, Bycroft, and Warburton 1955; Bycroft 1956; Richardson, Webster, and Warburton 1971; Warburton, Richardson, and Webster 1971; Luco and Contesse 1973; Trifunac 1972; Wong and Trifunac 1974; Saito and Wada 1977). However, in practice, the close form solutions are applicable only under certain circumstances, for example when the superstructure is considered as rigid and/or massless, and the shape of the foundation is circular, rectangular, or elliptical. Undoubtedly, it becomes indispensable to study the effect of soil-structure interaction for heavy structures such as concrete gravity dams.\nIn the previous chapter, it is shown that the dynamic SSI problem can be tackled as a wave-propagation (or wave-scattering) problem in an unbounded soil domain. In order to work with the finite computational domain artificial boundaries with appropriate absorbing boundary conditions are used to truncate the unbounded soil-domain. Finite element methods (FEM) have been widely used to solve dynamic SSI problem. FEM based on frequency domain are only applicable to the linear problem, therefore, incorporation of nonlinear material behavior will be a prohibitive task for them. FEM in time domain, on the other hand, do not suffer from such limitations. Finite element methods coupled with boundary element methods (FEM-BEM) in time domain have also been developed for dynamic SSI problems (Touhei and Ohmachi 1993; Yazdchi, Khalili, and Valliappan 1999; Chuhan, Feng, and Pekau 1995). In FEM-BEM, the domain is divided into near-field and far-field domain, subsequently, finite elements are used to model near-field while far-field is modeled by using boundary elements. FEM equipped with the infinite elements, a natural extension of finite elements to handle unbounded domains, have been proposed to solve wave propagation in unbounded domain (Bettess 1977; Medina and Penzien 1982; Valliappan and Zhao 1992; Zhao, Valliappan, and Wang 1992). In this approach, the near field is modeled by FEM and the far field is modeled by infinite elements.\nThis chapter extends the v-ST/FEM presented in Chapter 9 for the dynamic soil-structure interaction problems. In dynamic SSI problem, unbounded soil domain is truncated by placing artificial boundaries at some distance from the area of interest. Viscous boundary condition of Lysmer-Kuhlemeyer (Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer 1969) is modified by introducing additional boundary terms related to the free-field response of unbounded soil domain to facilitate the energy flow from far field to computation domain. In the computer program, modified viscous boundary condition is treated as a combination of various traction boundary conditions; traction boundary condition due to dashpots, free-field motion, and input seismic motion. It is found that the traction boundary condition due to dashpots introduces space-time dashpot matrices \\(\\left[ \\mathbf{C}_{\\infty}\\right]\\) which contribute to the space-time tangent matrix. The traction boundary condition due to input seismic motion and free-field motion introduce corresponding space-time nodal vectors. Furthermore, it is shown how multiple soil-column problems can be solved (with various boundary conditions) in order to compute the free-field response. Moreover, the computation of free-field response does not depend upon the total response of soil and structure. Thanks to this weak coupling, the soil-column problem can be solved first, and then the total response of soil and structure can be computed by using this free-field response. In this way, the proposed space-time finite element formulation is applicable to a wide class of soil-structure interaction problem.\nAfterwards, a dynamic dam-soil interaction problem is considered to validate the formulation and computer implementation of v-ST/FEM. In this problem, a dam (without the reservoir) resting on an elastic half-space is subjected to the horizontal component of the earthquake motion. The material damping in both dam and soil domain is modeled using the Rayleigh damping. The results obtained by proposed scheme are validated by solving the same problem using the semi-discrete FEM with classical Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method. Results obtained by two methods are compared and found to be nearly identical.",

    "text": "10.2 Statement of problem\nFigure 10.1 illustrates the computational setup for a typical two dimensional soil-structure interaction problem. The structure is allowed to exhibit nonlinear behavior and is partially (or fully) embedded in the unbounded domain. However, for clarity of v-ST/FEM formulation it will be assumed that the structure behaves linearly. The bounded and unbounded soil domain are assumed to behave linearly. In practice, the structure can represent a tunnel, a gravity dam with its foundation, a high-rise buildings, a thermal-nuclear power plant, among others. Let \\(\\Omega\\) be the truncated computational domain that contains both the structure and the linear bounded soil domain (see, Figure 10.1). Let \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\) denotes the artificial boundary of \\(\\Omega\\) where the viscous boundary conditions are imposed. \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\) is divided into left viscous boundary \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{L}\\), right viscous boundary \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{R}\\), and bottom viscous boundary \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{B}\\). Further, it is assumed that the seismic excitations are represented by vertically propagating waves and entering the computation domain \\(\\Omega\\) from the bottom viscous boundary only \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{B}\\).

Some of the traction boundary conditions related to the dynamic SSI problem are given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction condition due to the externally applied surface load on the boundary \\(\\Gamma_{i}^{h}\\) (see Figure 10.1) is given by\n\\[\n\\sigma_{ij}n_{j}=f^{s}_{i}\\quad \\,on\\quad \\Gamma_{i}^{h}\n\\tag{10.6}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction boundary conditions due to the series of dashpots arranged at the truncated absorbing (viscous) boundary \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{+}\\) in parallel and normal direction are derived in Equation 7.19 – Equation 7.20 and here rewritten as,\n\\[\n\\sigma_{n}=-\\rho c_{L} v_{n}\\\\\n\\tag{10.7}\\]\n\\[\n\\tau = -\\rho c_{T} v_{s}\n\\tag{10.8}\\]\nRecalling that in a typical two-dimensional SSI problem, the unbounded soil-domain is usually truncated by placing vertical and horizontal artificial boundaries at some distance from the area of interest.\nThe tensor component form of viscous boundary conditions Equation 10.7 – Equation 10.8 for vertical boundaries \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{L}\\) and \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{R}\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\sigma _{ij}{n_j} = -c_{ip}^v{v_p}\\quad \\,on \\quad  \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{L} \\cup \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{R}\n\\tag{10.9}\\]\nSimilarly, viscous boundary condition on the bottom horizontal truncated boundary \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{B}\\) can be written as,\n\\[\n\\sigma _{ij}{n_j} = -c_{ip}^h{v_p}\\quad \\,on \\quad  \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{B}\n\\tag{10.10}\\]\nIn Equation 10.9 – Equation 10.10, \\({{\\mathbf{c}}^v}\\) and \\({{\\mathbf{c}}^h}\\) denote the damping coefficients matrix for the dashpots that are placed at the vertical and horizontal truncated boundaries (see Figure 10.1).

The additional boundary terms are formulated in terms of free field motion \\((\\mathbf{u}^{f}, \\mathbf{v}^{f}, \\sigma^{f})\\) and given by\n\\[\n\\sigma _{ij}{n_j} = c_{ip}^v v^{f}_{p} + {\\sigma_{ip}^{f}}{n_p} \\quad \\,on \\quad  \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{L} \\cup \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{R}\n\\tag{10.13}\\]\nwhere, \\(n_p\\) is the \\(p^{th}\\) spatial component of outward normal vector at the artificial boundary, and the matrix \\(\\mathbf{c}^h\\) is same as the one given in Equation 10.12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction boundary condition at the bottom artificial boundary due to the incoming seismic waves, which allow the vertically propagating seismic waves to enter the computation, are derived in the previous Chapter (see Equation 7.51 and Equation 7.52). The tensor component form of these boundary condition is given by\n\\[\n\\sigma _{ij}^{in}{n_j} = 2c_{ip}^hv_p^{in} \\quad \\,on \\quad \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{B}\n\\tag{10.14}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{v}^{in}\\) is the incoming velocity wave.\n\n\n\nFor situations where the source of excitation resides in the computation domain the traction boundary conditions at the artificial boundary are due to the dashpots only, accordingly one can avoid Equation 10.13 and Equation 10.14 in the traction boundary condition. Moreover, if only Equation 10.6 is used to impose the traction boundary condition then the problem becomes identical to the one discussed in the previous Chapter.\nThe final form of traction boundary conditions used in this chapter are given by\n\\[\n\\sigma_{ij}n_{j}=f^{s}_{i}\\quad \\,on\\quad \\Gamma_{i}^{h}\n\\tag{10.15}\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma _{ij}{n_j} = -c_{ip}^v{v_p} + c_{ip}^v v^{f}_{p} + \\sigma_{ip}^{f}{n_p} \\quad \\,on \\quad  \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{L} \\cup \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{R}\n\\tag{10.16}\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma _{ij}{n_j} = -c_{ip}^h{v_p} + 2c_{ip}^hv_p^{in} \\quad \\,on \\quad  \\Gamma_{\\infty}^{B}\n\\tag{10.17}\\]\nThe vector form is described by\n\\[\n\\sigma \\cdot {\\mathbf{n}} = {{\\mathbf{f}}^s}\\quad \\,on\\quad \\,\\Gamma _{}^h\\\\\n\\tag{10.18}\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma  \\cdot {\\mathbf{n}} =  - {{\\mathbf{c}}^v} \\cdot {\\mathbf{v}} + {{\\mathbf{c}}^v} \\cdot {{\\mathbf{v}}^{f}} + {\\sigma^{f}} \\cdot {\\mathbf{n}}\\quad \\,on\\quad \\,\\Gamma _\\infty ^L \\cup \\Gamma_\\infty ^R\\\\\n\\tag{10.19}\\]\n\\[\n\\sigma  \\cdot {\\mathbf{n}} =  - {\\mathbf{c}}_{}^h{\\mathbf{v}} + 2{{\\mathbf{c}}^h} \\cdot {{\\mathbf{v}}^{in}}\\quad \\,on\\quad \\,\\Gamma_\\infty ^B\n\\tag{10.20}\\]",

Besides, \\(\\mathbf{v}^{f}\\) and \\(\\sigma^{f}\\) are computed by solving an elastodynamics problem defined for the auxiliary state as discussed in the previous chapter.\nFurther, under following assumptions the computation of free-field response simplifies significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumption 1\n\n\n\nThe seismic motion is described by vertically propagating body waves (P-wave and S-wave)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumption 2\n\n\n\nThe unbounded soil domain is represented by an isotropic, linear elastic layered half-space.\n\n\nWith these assumptions a multi-dimension auxiliary state problem effectively transform into a soil-column problem (Nielsen 2006; Zienkiewicz, Bicanic, and Shen 1989; Y. Zhang et al. 2003; Miura and Okinaka 1989; Saouma et al. 2011) where the body waves propagate through a layered soil-column (see Figure 10.2). The governing equation for the soil-column problem is given by Equation 10.1 with the modified Dirichlet boundary condition (as discussed below). The top surface of the soil-column \\(\\Gamma_{t}^{sc}\\) is a stress-free boundary. The traction boundary condition at bottom surface of soil-column,\\(\\Gamma_{b}^{sc}\\) is due to the incoming seismic motion and the dashpots (see Figure 10.2). The analysis of soil-column problem could be performed as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf only horizontal component of the seismic excitation is present then free-field displacement and velocity are computed while vertical displacement of all nodes of soil-column mesh is constrained (thus allowing only the shear deformation of soil-column, see Figure 10.2 b .

In first stage horizontal response is computed; only the horizontal seismic motion is applied at the base of the soil-column while constraining the vertical displacement of all nodes, and problem is analyzed (see Figure 10.2 b). In second stage vertical response of soil-column is computed; only the vertical seismic motion is applied at the base of the soil-column while constraining the horizontal displacement of all nodes, and problem is analyzed (see Figure 10.2 c).

To assess the performance of v-ST/FEM for the soil-structure interaction problem (with modified viscous boundaries) the effect of reservoir will not be pursued here. Besides, the effect of reservoir will be discussed in next chapter.\nFigure 10.3 depicts a concrete gravity dam on an unbounded soil domain. The physical dimension of the dam is given in Figure 10.4. It is assumed that the material behavior of the dam as well as the soil is given by an isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic stress-strain relationship. For the concrete-dam, the elastic modulus \\(E=28.0\\) GPa, mass-density \\(\\rho=\\) 2347.0 kg/m\\({}^{3}\\), and the Poisson’s ratio \\(\\nu=0.20\\). For the soil, \\(E=40\\) GPa, \\(\\rho=2551.0\\) kg/m\\({}^{3}\\), and \\(\\nu=0.20\\). Further, material damping is modeled by Rayleigh damping with \\(\\xi = 5\\)% viscous damping specified for the soil and dam separately; the resultant values of damping coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) for the dam and soil are given in Table 10.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Numerical example for the dynamic soil structure interaction problem; concrete gravity dam on an elastic half-space\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Material parameters of the dam and soil domain (\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are Rayleigh damping coefficients)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nElastic modulus, \\(E\\), (GPa)\nPoisson’s ratio \\(\\nu\\)\nMass density \\(\\rho\\) (kg/m3)\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nDam\n\\(28.0\\)\n\\(0.2\\)\n\\(2347.0\\)\n\\(4.1314\\)\n\\(4.8\\times 10^{-4}\\)\n\n\n\nSoil\n\\(40.0\\)\n\\(0.2\\)\n\\(2551.0\\)\n\\(1.612\\)\n\\(1.47\\times 10^{-3}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: Physical dimension and finite element mesh detail of concrete gravity dam used for the numerical simulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Horizontal component of acceleration recorded at the free-surface: (A) time history, and (B) Fourier spectrum\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4 illustrates the physical dimension and finite element mesh of the truncated computational domain (\\(\\Omega\\)). The length of soil domain in \\(x_{1}\\)-direction is nine times the length of base of the dam, and the length in \\(x_{2}\\)-direction is three times the height of the dam. The computational domain is descritised using \\(19,176\\) number of four node quadrilateral (Quad4) elements and \\(453\\) number of three-node linear triangle (Tria3) elements (see Figure 10.4). There are total \\(19,559\\) number of nodes in the mesh, hence the total number of primary unknowns to be determined are \\(78,236\\) (four times the total number of nodes).\nThe simulation is carried out for the horizontal seismic motion recorded at some control point on the free surface (see Figure 10.5. Total time duration of ground motion is \\(45\\) seconds in which acceleration is set to zero after \\(40\\) seconds. Figure 10.5 a depicts the time history of the recorded acceleration; the maximum and minimum values of acceleration are \\(396.7\\) cm/s\\({}^{2}\\) and \\(-449.6\\) cm/s\\({}^{2}\\), respectively. The Fourier spectrum of acceleration is depicted in Figure 10.5 b where the dominating amplitudes \\(21.9\\) cm/s\\({}^{2}\\) and \\(19.4\\) cm/s\\({}^{2}\\) occur for frequencies \\(1.24\\) Hz and \\(2.0\\) Hz, respectively. The input seismic acceleration \\(a_{1}^{in}(t)\\) for the numerical simulation is taken as half that of acceleration at the free surface.\nFigure 10.6 illustrates the configuration of the components required for the computation of present problem. Dashpots are placed on the bottom and vertical boundaries of computation domain. Recall that, in this situation, only a single soil-column problem needs to be solved for determining the free-field response. In the soil-column problem vertical motion of all nodes is constrained while dashpots are placed at the bottom (see Figure 10.6) surface only. Furthermore, material properties of the soil column (including Rayleigh damping coefficients \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\)) are identical to that of soil-domain (see Table 10.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: Physical dimension and finite element mesh detail of computational domain used for the numerical simulation\n\n\n\nFor the validation of v-ST/FEM, the same problem is solved using semi-discrete FEM with Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) direct time integration algorithm. A uniform time-step of size \\(\\Delta t = 0.01\\) sec is adopted for both methods. In case of v-ST/FEM, the tolerance for GpBiCG (iterative linear solver) is set to \\(\\epsilon = 1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\). The observation points selected for the comparison of results are shown in Figure 10.4. The spatial coordinates of these points are; point-1 \\((40.0,0.0)\\), point-2 \\((0.0, 0.0)\\), point-3 \\((0.0, 35.0)\\), and point-4 \\((0.0, 50.0)\\). Temporal variation of horizontal component of acceleration at observation points computed by employing v-ST/FEM and Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method are plotted in Figure 10.7 – Figure 10.10 . In case of point-1 and point-2 the results computed by present method are almost identical to that of Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method (see Figure 10.7) and Figure 10.8.\nIn case of point-3 and point-4, however, due to the algorithmic damping of v-ST/FEM the response obtained by v-ST/FEM is slightly lower than the one obtained by the Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method3. To further explain this point, frequency content of the acceleration response at the observation points is plotted in Figure 10.11, where it can be seen that the dominating frequencies for point-1 and point-2 are in between \\(1\\) Hz and \\(2\\) Hz, and for point-3 and point-4 are in between \\(6\\) Hz and \\(8\\) Hz. In the previous Chapter, it is shown that the v-ST/FEM has relatively large numerical damping for high-frequency content, therefore, the response of point-3 and point-4 is more damped than the response of point-1 and point-2.\nIn Figure 10.12 the frequency content of horizontal acceleration obtained by v-ST/FEM is illustrated. At the base of the dam (i.e. point-1 and point-2 in Figure 10.4) the frequency content is similar to the recorded acceleration, and the dominating frequencies are also located in between \\(1\\) Hz and \\(2\\) Hz. The high frequency content in the dynamic response of the dam starts dominating as one moves away from the base towards the crest of the dam. This is because a significant part of wave energy that enter the dam through dam-soil interface gets trapped inside the dam-region due to multiple reflections within the dam. To further understand this point, consider the boundaries of the dam, the three free surfaces of the dam (upstream face, downstream face and top surface) act as a perfect reflector. From Table 10.1 it is clear that the the mechanical impedance of the soil is more than that of dam. Therefore, when a wave, which is coming from the dam-region, impinges the dam-soil interface it partially gets reflected back into the dam-region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Comparison of horizontal component of acceleration at point-1 computed by using the v-ST/FEM and Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.8: Comparison of horizontal component of acceleration at point-2 computed by using the v-ST/FEM and Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.9: Comparison of horizontal component of acceleration at point-3 computed by using the v-ST/FEM and Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.10: Comparison of horizontal component of acceleration at point-4 computed by using the v-ST/FEM and Newmark-\\(\\beta\\) method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.11: Comparison of Fourier spectrum of horizontal component of acceleration obtained by employing v-ST/FEM and Newmark-\\(\\beta\\); (A) Point-1, (B) Point-2, (C) Point-3, (D) Point-4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.12: Fourier spectrum of horizontal component of acceleration obtained by employing v-ST/FEM for different observation points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArnold, R.

    "text": "The stability of dams during an event of earthquake is critical as failure of such a structure may have catastrophic effects on life and property. When a dam-reservoir-soil system is subjected to the earthquake-motion the hydrodynamic effects induced by the impounded water may intensify the dynamic response of the dam. In addition, the dynamic stresses in the dam depend on the dynamic coupling between the dam, the water in reservoir, and the underlying soil. It is therefore necessary to develop the numerical methods for evaluating the adequacy of a given dam-design against a particular ground motion. Seismic analysis of a dam-reservoir system can be viewed as a problem of dynamic fluid-structure interaction; the ground motion and the deformations of the upstream face of a dam will generate hydrodynamic pressure in the reservoir, and the structure deformations in turn will be affected by the distribution of hydrodynamic pressures at the upstream face. Therefore, the estimation of precise hydrodynamic forces on upstream face of the dam due to earthquakes is one of the key aspects of the analysis and design of dams. In 1933, prof. H.M. Westergaard firstly proposed a standard procedure to take into account the hydrodynamic effects on gravity dam subjected to the earthquake loading. In literature this procedure is well known as Westergaard’s added-mass approach. (Westergaard 1933) made following assumptions in order to derive an expression for the hydrodynamic pressure exerted on upstream face of the dam.\n\nDam was idealized as two-dimensional rigid structure with vertical upstream face.\nWater in the reservoir is incompressible, and reservoir extends to infinity in the upstream direction.\nThe amplitudes of displacements of fluid particles are small.\nThe existence of surface waves at free surface of reservoir was ignored.\nOnly horizontal ground motion in the direction perpendicular to the vertical upstream face was considered.\n\nUnder aforementioned assumptions, Prof. Westergaard posed the initial-boundary value problem, and obtained pressure solutions at upstream face of the dam. For the purpose of practical engineering use, he approximated the hydrodynamic pressure distribution at upstream face of the dam by a parabola. He observed that the hydrodynamic pressure was same as if a certain body of fluid was firmly attached to the upstream face of dam and forced to move back and forth with the dam while the remainder of the reservoir is left in active. The amount of water included was determined by equating the inertia forces of this body of water to the pressure that actually were exerted upon the faces of the dam under the same motion of the dam. Accordingly, he suggested that the hydrodynamic pressure at face of the dam could be expressed as:\n\\[\np\\left( {y,t} \\right) = \\frac{7}{8}\\rho {a_g}\\left( t \\right)\\sqrt {{H^f}\\left( {{H^f} - y} \\right)}\n\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is vertical distance from the base of the dam, \\(a_{g}\\) is the horizontal ground-acceleration, \\(H^{f}\\) is the height of the reservoir, \\(t\\) is time, and \\(p(z,t)\\) is the hydrodynamic pressure at height \\(y\\) from base of the dam applied normally to the face of the dam.\nAbove equation indicates that the hydrodynamic pressure is equivalent to the inertia force of a prismatic body of water of unit cross-section area and length \\(\\frac{7}{8}\\sqrt {{H^f}\\left( {{H^f} - y} \\right)}\\) attached firmly to face of the dam, and moving with dam back and forth (with total acceleration \\(a_{g}\\)) in the direction normal to the face of the dam without friction. This body of the dam (added-mass) is confined in a volume bounded by a two-dimensional parabolic surface on the upstream side of the dam. Although the case prof. Westergaard studied was limited to rigid dams with vertical upstream face, and infinitely long reservoir, ignoring surface waves and considering only small displacements of fluid particles, this work was regarded as a milestone. Especially, the concept of added-mass, which he introduced for incompressible water reservoir, greatly simplified the analysis procedure of the response of dam considering the hydrodynamic effects during earthquakes.\nIn the same year, von (Kármán 1933) obtained the expression for hydrodynamic pressure force and total load on a rigid dam with a vertical upstream face by using the principle of conservation of linear momentum. These results were very close to the Westergaard results. (Kotsubo 1957; Chopra 1967; Victoria, Herrera, and Lozano 1969) performed comprehensive analysis of hydrodynamic pressures on the vertical upstream face of a rigid dam due to horizontal as well as vertical components of ground-acceleration. (Chopra 1967) showed that significant errors are introduced by ignoring the compressibility of water, and hydrodynamic forces due to vertical component of ground motion are much larger than those due to horizontal ground motion when the height of water in reservoir is small, however, these forces become comparable as the height of water increases. (Victoria, Herrera, and Lozano 1969) found that hydrodynamic pressure due to vertical ground motion are strongly influenced by the direction of approach and the velocity of propagation of the earthquake.\n(Chopra 1968, 1970) studied the hydrodynamic interaction between a reservoir and a linear elastic dam with vertical upstream face due to horizontal ground motion. The dynamic response of the dam was approximated by its deformations in the fundamental mode. It was found that the interaction effects have considerable influence on the behavior of dam-reservoir system; the resonant period as well as earthquake response is significantly influenced by hydrodynamic interaction and compressibility of water. In addition, it was demonstrated that the compressibility of water can be ignored if the dam is flexible enough compared to the reservoir.\nFurther, the analysis of hydrodynamic pressure on the dam due to the vertical component of ground motion demands the modeling of reservoir bed. The simplest assumption is to treat the reservoir bottom as a rigid foundation, which leads to the perfect reflection of pressure waves at the reservoir bottom, and spatially uniform ground-acceleration. However, this assumption may result in unrealistically large hydrodynamic pressure at the upstream face of the dam because the reservoir-bottom condition does not allow energy dissipation in the reservoir domain. The excessive hydrodynamic pressure at vertical upstream face will cause large deformations in the dam which in turn will influence the hydrodynamic response of reservoir.\n(Chakrabarti and Chopra 1973b) investigated the hydrodynamic pressure and structural response of concrete gravity dam with vertical upstream face, including the dam-reservoir interaction, due to vertical component of earthquake ground motion. The response of the dam was approximated by the deformation in the fundamental mode of vibration, and the effect of flexibility of reservoir bottom was included in the analysis. It was showed the structural response to the vertical component of ground motion is significant in the presence of reservoir. This is obvious as the vertical movement of ground may increase the hydrodynamic pressure acting perpendicular to the dam face, which in turn may cause the additional deformation in the dam. The response was especially significant for low height dams in which case the response to vertical component of ground motion can be larger than the response to horizontal component of a ground motion.\n(Chakrabarti and Chopra 1973a) presented a general procedure for analysis of the response of gravity dams with vertical upstream face, including the hydrodynamic interaction and compressibility of water, to both horizontal and vertical components of ground motion. Their approach is based on a substructure coupling technique in which the dam and the fluid domain are treated as separate substructure, and displacements of the dam are represented as a linear combination of the first few modes of vibration of the dam with the reservoir empty and rigid foundation.\n(Chwang and Housner 1978) used von Karman’s momentum-balance approach and Westergaard added-mass approach to obtain analytical solution for the hydrodynamic pressure distribution along the inclined upstream face of a rigid-dam which subjected to horizontal ground-motion. In this study they found that at any fixed point on the upstream face of dam the pressure decreases as the inclination angle (of the face of dam) decreases. However, for fixed values of inclination angle between \\(0\\) and \\(90 \\, {}^{\\circ}\\), the maximum hydrodynamic pressure occurs at the base of the dam. Further, (Chwang 1978) employed the two-dimensional potential-flow theory to obtain the exact intergral solution of the problem considered in (Chwang and Housner 1978). It was observed that for any fixed angle of inclination of upstream face of the dam the momentum-method (Chwang and Housner 1978) (approximate theory) indicates that the maximum pressure occurs at the base of the dam, whereas the exact theory (Chwang 1978) gives the maximum pressure at some distance above the base of the dam. However, in case of vertical upstream face of the dam both approximate theory and exact theory predicts maximum pressure at the base of the dam.\n(Hall and Chopra 1982) investigated the effects of dam-fluid interaction, water compressibility, fluid-foundation interaction, reservoir shape, and extent of vertical ground motion on the dynamic response of concrete gravity dam. Fluid-foundation interaction was approximately simulated by means of an absorbing boundary condition applied at the bottom of the reservoir, while the foundation was assumed to be rigid. They reported that if the water in the reservoir is assumed as incompressible then the hydrodynamic effects are equivalent to an added mass and added load which reduce the resonant frequencies of the system and change the resonant amplitudes. In this case the dam accelerations with full reservoir are essentially independent of reservoir shape. Further, in the case where water compressibility is considered and fluid-foundation interaction is neglected the dam accelerations strongly depend on the reservoir shape. The net effect of fluid-foundation interaction is to reduce the response of dam, and the resultant dam accelerations depend much less on reservoir shape, especially for horizontal ground motion.\nThe reservoir bottom (or the top of bedrock foundation) in upstream direction may consist a deposition of a sediment layer of considerable depth. The effect of sedimentary layers is to partially absorb the incident hydrodynamic pressure waves and facilitate the energy dissipation in the reservoir domain. (Fenves and Chopra 1983) studied the effect of reservoir bottom absorption on the hydrodynamic pressure in reservoir and the dynamic response of concrete gravity dams. Reservoir bottom absorption effect was modeled by means of an absorbing boundary condition applied at the bottom of reservoir allowing the partial absorption of hydrodynamic pressure waves at the reservoir bottom. The foundation underneath the dam-reservoir system was assumed to be rigid. It was concluded that the reservoir bottom absorption-effect can significantly reduce the resonant response of gravity dams to both horizontal and vertical ground motion components. This reduction in response becomes more substantial as stiffness of the dam increases. The decrease in resonant frequency of the dam due to dam-water interaction is less pronounced for a wave absorptive reservoir bottom than for a rigid reservoir bottom. The assumption of water incompressibility overestimates both resonant response and response to high excitation frequencies due to horizontal ground motion, in addition, this assumption also underestimate the importance of the response to the vertical ground motion.\n(Cheng 1986) modeled the reservoir bottom as a poroelastic sediment layer of finite extent situated on top of an elastic half-space. It was showed that in case of saturated pore water the interaction between the sediment and the reservoir is negligible. Even a thin sediment layer, however, can significantly modify the reservoir response if the pore water is slightly desaturated. It was found that the resonance frequency of the system decreases and amplitude increases as the water compressibility increases. Further, it was observed that in case of highly permeable, partially saturated, and stiff sediment layer the hydrodynamic force on the rigid dam decreases significantly.\n(Chopra and Chakrabarti 1981) presented a general procedure for analysis of the dynamic response of the dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system to the horizontal and vertical components of earthquake motions. The method was based on a substructure coupling technique in which the DRS system was divided into three substructures; the dam, the reservoir with infinite length in upstream direction, and the semi-infinite viscoelastic soil domain. The displacements of the dam were expressed as a linear combination of Ritz vectors, which are selected as normal modes of an associated undamped dam-soil system.\n(Lotfi, Roesset, and Tassoulas 1987) developed a finite element procedure for the problems of dynamic interaction of dam-reservoir-soil systems. They devised a technique based on the interface elements (called the hyper-elements) for rigorous modeling of all interactions, such as reservoir-soil interaction, reservoir-dam, and dam-soil interaction. In this study they concluded that the wave reflection approach presented in (Hall and Chopra 1982; Fenves and Chopra 1983) to model the reservoir bottom absorption effect underestimate the response of the dam. (Medina, Dominguez, and Tassoulas 1990) rigorously model the reservoir-foundation interaction in their method of analysis, which was based on boundary element method, and found that, although the Chopra’s scheme to model the sediment layer (Hall and Chopra 1982; Fenves and Chopra 1983) was capable of providing a reasonably accurate prediction of the response to a vertical excitation, it underestimated the peak value of crest acceleration caused by harmonic horizontal excitation. (Hatami 1997) modified the wave reflection approach presented by the Chopra and coworkers to model the reservoir bottom absorption effects in the seismic analysis of the gravity dam. Hatami’s model explicitly accounts for the thickness as well as the effects of wave attenuation in the sediment layer and reflection of waves from the underlying foundation rock. In addition, Hatami’s model also utilizes the mechanical parameters of the sediment layer and the foundation rock. Unfortunately, the model is only applicable when the analysis is performed in frequency domain.\nIn the finite element analysis of dynamic dam-reservoir interaction problems, difficulties arise mainly because of the large extent of the fluid domain, where fluid is practically unbounded. The infinite reservoir domain is usually truncated by placing the artificial boundaries in the upstream direction at some distance from the dam. In the finite representation of such domains, a proper boundary condition must be applied at the artificial boundary to represent the effects of radiation damping. (Saini, Bettess, and Zienkiewicz 1978) developed the special finite elements extending to infinity to model the large extent of reservoir. These infinite elements naturally satisfies the Sommerfeld radiation condition at the infinity. Their method of analysis was based on the substructure coupling technique in which the reservoir and the dam were handled as two substructures. The dam was discretized by using standard finite elements, which were coupled with the infinite fluid elements. This technique depend upon the frequency of vibration and, therefore, unsuitable for a time domain analysis. (Sharan 1987) proposed a simple boundary condition to model the effects of radiation damping in the analysis of hydrodynamic pressures. It was also showed that the Sommerfeld boundary condition at the truncated upstream boundary of reservoir does not truly represent the effect of radiation damping, particularly when the excitation frequency is less than the second natural frequency of the reservoir. The use of the Sommerfeld boundary condition, therefore, requires large extent of the fluid domain to be considered in the analysis. From the numerical experiments he showed that the modified damping condition is advantageous as absorbing boundary can be placed at relatively short distance from the dam as compared to distance required in case of the Sommerfeld damping condition. (Yang, Tsai, and Lee 1993; Maity and Bhattacharyya 1999) proposed the explicit time-domain transmitting boundary condition for the analysis of dam-reservoir interactions. These boundary conditions are more accurate than Sharan’s boundary conditions, however, their finite element implementation is relatively tedious. Recently, researchers (Basu and Chopra 2004; Prempramote et al. 2009; Birk, Prempramote, and Song 2012; Lin, Wang, and Hu 2012; Samii and Lotfi 2012) have developed sophisticated procedures to model the dam-reservoir interaction problems.\nVarious computational techniques have been proposed in the literature to model the coupling phenomenon in dam-reservoir interaction problem. The simplest procedure being adopted is that both fluid and solid domain are coupled and solved as a one system. (Zienkiewicz and Newton 1969; Müller 1981) used pressure as the unknown in the fluid and displacements in the solid, but the resultant equations lead to unsymmetrical matrices. (Olson and Bathe 1985) used velocity potential and a hydrostatic pressure as unknown in each fluid region, and used displacements as unknown in the solid. The use of pressure as unknown in fluid and displacement in solid results in unsymmetrical matrices. (Sandberg and Goransson 1988) obtained a symmetrical system by using pressure and a displacement potential to describe the fluid domain. Their formulation allows the use of different nodal interpolation for pressure and displacement potential. Further, number of unknowns can be reduced by employing static condensation to the pressure field. (Belytschko and Kennedy 1976; Bathe and Hahn 1979; Wilson and Khalvati 1983; Chen and Taylor 1990; Pelecanos, Kontoe, and Zdravković 2013) used displacements as the nodal variable in both the solid and fluid domain. However, these formulations suffer from the presence of spurious zero-energy modes unless an irrotational constraint with/without reduced integration scheme is taken into account. (Bermúdez et al. 1995) also used displacement variables for both fluid and the solid domain. But they employed linear elements for the solid domain and nonconforming Raviart-Thomas elements of lower order for the fluid domain to eliminate the zero-energy modes. The advantage of the displacement-based formulation is that the fluid elements can easily be coupled to the structural elements using standard finite element assembly procedures. But the degrees of freedom for the fluid domain increase significantly.\nThe coupled modeled of dam-reservoir interaction problems may be achieved using the substructure techniques, in which different domains are modeled as separate computational entities amongst which interaction effects are communicated. (Ghaemian and Ghobarah 1998) presented two unconditionally stable staggered coupling schemes, in time domain, for the dam-reservoir interaction problem. The fist scheme was based on approximation of the displacement from the equation of motion in the solid domain. The second scheme was based on approximation of the pressure from the governing equation of fluid-domain. (Maity and Bhattacharyya 2003) suggested an iterative scheme in connection with the staggered solution procedure for the dam-reservoir interaction problem. More details regarding the iterative coupling techniques for dam-reservoir interaction problem can be found in literature (Park 1980, 1983; Felippa and Geers 1988; Felippa, Park, and Farhat 2001; Jahromi, Izzuddin, and Zdravkovic 2009; Soares and Godinho 2014).\nThe objective of this chapter is to compute the seismic response of the dam-reservoir (DR) and dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system while considering all types of dynamic interaction. The layout of this chapter is as follows. In Section 2 governing equations for DR and DRS system are presented. Viscous boundary conditions, which contains the contribution of free-field response of DR and DRS system, are applied at the artificial boundaries of computation domain. In Section 3, computation details related to the free-field response of DR and DRS system are discussed. Section 4 presents the v-ST/FEM weak form for the DR and DRS system. The space-time finite element discretization of the weak form and computer implementation of v-ST/FEM formulation are given in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively. In later section, a block-iterative scheme is devised to solve the coupled equations of fluid and solid domain. InSection 7, various dam-reservoir interaction problems are solved to demonstrate the performance of the present approach. Lastly, for the verification of the proposed scheme, results obtained by using v-ST/FEM are compared with the results available in literature.\n\n\n\n\nBasu, Ushnish, and Anil K Chopra. 2004. “Perfectly Matched Layers for Transient Elastodynamics of Unbounded Domains.” International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering 59 (8): 1039–74.\n\n\nBathe, K.

    "text": "12.1 Governing equation for dam-reservoir system\nFigure 12.1 illustrates a dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system that consists of following components;\nIn practice, sometimes, the structure is situated on a relatively very stiff soil. In such cases, the effect of interaction with the soil can be neglected. Subsequently, a DRS system can simply be represented by a dam-reservoir (DR) system (see Figure 12.2) where the dynamic interaction between structure (dam) and reservoir plays a major role. It is natural, therefore, to start with the governing equations of a DR system, and subsequently extending them to include the effect of dynamic soil-structure interaction.\nFigure 12.2 depicts the dam-reservoir system situated on a relatively rigid ground which is subjected to the transient ground motion. The horizontal and vertical component of ground motion are denoted by \\(a_{1}^{g}(t)\\) and \\(a_{2}^{g}(t)\\), respectively. Note that the ground motion is assumed to be spatially-uniform. Henceforth, the superscript \\({(\\cdot)}^{s}\\) and \\({(\\cdot)}^{f}\\) will be used for denoting the quantities related to the solid (dam) and fluid domain, respectively. Let \\(\\Omega^{f}\\) be the computation domain for fluid (i.e. reservoir) with free surface denoted by \\(\\Gamma_{f}^{f}\\) and upstream artificial boundary denoted by \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{f}\\). The fluid-soil interface (of fluid domain \\(\\Omega^{f}\\)) – the bottom boundary of fluid domain which is in contact with the ground – is denoted by \\(\\Gamma^{f}_{fs}\\). The fluid-dam interface of the fluid domain is represented by \\(\\Gamma_{fd}^{f}\\). Let \\(\\Omega^{s}\\) denote the finite computation domain for solid which, in the present case, is occupied by the dam body. The fluid-dam interface of solid domain is represented by \\(\\Gamma_{fd}^{s}\\). The outward unit normal vectors to the fluid and solid boundary are denoted by \\(\\mathbf{n}^{s}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{n}^{f}\\), respectively.\nNeglecting the internal viscosity, and assuming the water to be linearly compressible with a small amplitudes for the displacements and velocity, the hydrodynamic pressure distribution in the reservoir is governed by the pressure wave equation (Zienkiewicz and Taylor 2005),\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{{{c^2}}}\\frac{{{\\partial ^2}p}}{{\\partial {t^2}}} - \\frac{{{\\partial ^2}p}}{{\\partial x_i^2}} = 0\n\\tag{12.1}\\]\nwhere \\(p(\\vec{x},t)\\) is the hydrodynamic pressure in the water (in excess of hydrostatic pressure), and \\(c\\) is the speed of sound in water. Further, it is assumed that the water in the reservoir is initially at rest conditions,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\np\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},0} \\right) &= 0; & \\frac{{\\partial p\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},0} \\right)}}{{\\partial t}} = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{12.2}\\]\nThe hydrodynamic pressure distribution within the reservoir domain is obtained by solving Equation 12.1 with the following boundary conditions.\n\\[\np(x,t) = 0 \\quad \\forall (\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\Gamma^{f}_{f} \\times (0,T)\n\\tag{12.3}\\]\nIf, however, one wishes to include the effect of surface-gravity waves while solving the dynamic DRI problem then the boundary condition is given by linearized surface wave condition (Zienkiewicz and Taylor 2005)\n\\[\n\\frac{{\\partial p}}{{\\partial {x_2}}} =  - \\frac{1}{g}\\frac{{{\\partial ^2}p}}{{\\partial {t^2}}} \\quad \\forall (\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\Gamma^{f}_{f} \\times (0,T)\n\\tag{12.4}\\]\nwhere \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity, \\(x_{2}\\)-axis is in the vertical direction, and the free surface is parallel to the \\(x_{1}\\)-axis.\nIn this thesis the effect of surface-gravity wave is not considered, hence, the boundary condition Equation 12.3 will be adopted.\n\\[\n\\nabla \\left( {p - {p^f}} \\right) \\cdot {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} =  - \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{{\\partial \\left( {p - {p^f}} \\right)}}{{\\partial t}} \\quad \\forall (\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\Gamma^{f}_{\\infty} \\times (0,T)\n\\tag{12.5}\\]\nwhere \\(p^{f}\\) is the free-field response of reservoir, and \\((p-p^{f})\\) denotes the scattered pressure wave. Eq. [eq-ch6-5] signifies that the outgoing scattered waves are traveling towards infinity and no spurious reflection of scattered waves will take place at the truncated boundary. After rearrangement of the terms in Eq. [eq-ch6-5],\n\\[\n\\nabla p \\cdot {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} =  - \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{{\\partial p}}{{\\partial t}} + \\nabla {p^f} \\cdot {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} + \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{{\\partial {p^f}}}{{\\partial t}} \\quad \\forall (\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\Gamma^{f}_{\\infty} \\times (0,T)\n\\]\nIn Equation 12.5 the first term corresponds to an array of dashpots (with damping coefficient equal to \\(1/c\\)) placed normal to the absorbing boundary \\(\\Gamma^{f}_{f}\\), and last two terms corresponds to the free-field response of reservoir (see Figure 12.3). It will be shown in next section that the free-response of reservoir \\(p^{f}\\) can effectively be given by \\(p^{f}=p^{f}(x_{2},t)\\). In addition, noting that the outward normal vector \\(\\mathbf{n}^{f}\\) at \\(\\Gamma^{f}_{\\infty}\\) is \\([-1,0]^{T}\\), the second term in above equation vanishes and following traction boundary condition can be obtained\n\\[\n\\nabla p \\cdot {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} =  - \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{{\\partial p}}{{\\partial t}}  + \\frac{1}{c}\\frac{{\\partial {p^f}}}{{\\partial t}} \\quad \\forall (\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\Gamma^{f}_{\\infty} \\times (0,T)\n\\tag{12.6}\\]\n\\[\n\\nabla p \\cdot {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} =  - {\\rho ^f}\\frac{{\\partial {\\mathbf{v}}}}{{\\partial t}} \\cdot {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} \\quad \\forall (\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\Gamma^{f}_{fd} \\times (0,T)\n\\tag{12.7}\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho^{f}\\) is the mass density of water, and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the total velocity of the material points of dam that belong to the interface \\(\\Gamma^{f}_{fd}\\).\n\\[\n\\nabla p \\cdot {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} =  - {\\rho ^f}{{\\mathbf{a}}^g} \\cdot {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} - {q_c}\\frac{{\\partial p}}{{\\partial t}} \\quad \\forall (\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\Gamma^{f}_{fs} \\times (0,T)\n\\tag{12.8}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbf{a}^{g}(t)\\) is the acceleration of ground, and \\(q_{c}\\) is the damping coefficient which is the fundamental parameter characterizing the effect of reservoir bottom materials and it is given in (Fenves and Chopra 1983) as,\n\\[\n{q_c} = \\frac{{1 - {\\alpha_b}}}{{c\\left( {1 + {\\alpha _b}} \\right)}}\n\\tag{12.9}\\]\nin which \\(\\alpha_{b}\\) is the ratio of the amplitude of reflected hydrodynamic pressure wave to the amplitude of a vertically propagating pressure wave incident on the reservoir bottom. The wave reflection coefficient \\(\\alpha_{b}\\) is more physically meaningful description than \\(q_{c}\\) of the behavior of hydrodynamic pressure waves at the reservoir bottom. The wave reflection coefficient \\(\\alpha_{b}\\) may range within the limiting values of \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\). For \\(\\alpha_{b}=1\\) the reservoir-bottom acts as the perfect reflector for the pressure waves, and \\(\\alpha_{b}=-1\\) models a very soft reservoir bottom (or foundation).\nThe second term in Equation 12.8 represents the modification of the vertical free-field ground acceleration due to interaction between the impounded water and the foundation medium. Due to this term the reservoir bottom also produces a damping effect representing the energy radiated through refraction (or absorption) of hydrodynamic pressure waves into the foundation medium away from the dam-water system. Accordingly, this term signifies the dynamic interaction between the reservoir water and the ground which permits partial absorption of hydrodynamic pressure waves at the reservoir bottom.\nLastly, computation domain of fluid, in the dam-reservoir system with a rigid foundation, and the aforementioned boundary conditions are illustrated in Figure 12.3.\nLet us now discuss the governing equation for the solid domain (recall that in DR-system the solid domain is occupied by dam only) which is given by,\n\\[\n\\rho^{s}\\frac{{\\partial v_i}}{{\\partial t}} - \\frac{{\\partial {\\sigma_{ij}}}}{{\\partial {x_j}}} - {\\rho ^s}{b_i} = 0 \\quad \\forall (\\mathbf{x},t) \\in \\Omega^{s}\\times (0,T)\n\\tag{12.10}\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho^{s}\\) is the mass density of the solid domain. Further, for an isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic material stress-strain relationship is described by\n\\[\n{\\sigma *{ij}} = \\lambda {\\epsilon*{kk}}{\\delta *{ij}} + 2\\mu {\\epsilon*{ij}}\n\\tag{12.11}\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\mu\\) are the Lame parameters, and\n\\[\n{\\epsilon _{ij}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( {\\frac{{\\partial {u_i}}}{{\\partial {x_j}}} + \\frac{{\\partial {u_j}}}{{\\partial {x_i}}}} \\right)\n\\tag{12.12}\\]\nThe initial conditions for the solid domain are\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n{u_i}\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},0} \\right) = u_i^0\\left( {\\mathbf{x}} \\right)\\quad \\,\\forall {\\mathbf{x}} \\in {\\Omega ^s}\n\\\\\n{v_i}\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},0} \\right) = v_i^0\\left( {\\mathbf{x}} \\right)\\quad \\,\\forall {\\mathbf{x}} \\in {\\Omega ^s}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{12.13}\\]\nand the Dirichlet boundary condition is described by\n\\[\n{u_i}\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},t} \\right) = {g_i}\\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},t} \\right)\\quad \\,\\forall \\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},t} \\right) \\in \\Gamma _i^g \\times \\left( {0,T} \\right)\n\\tag{12.14}\\]\nIn case of DR-system, the traction boundary condition for solid domain can be decomposed into (i) traction boundary condition due to externally applied surface loads (see Equation 12.15), (ii) traction boundary condition due to total pressure (hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure) of impounded water acting on \\(\\Gamma^{s}_{fd}\\) (see Equation 12.16).\n\\[\n{\\sigma *{ij}}n_j^s = {f^{s}*{i}}\\quad \\,\\forall \\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},t} \\right) \\in \\Gamma _{i,h}^s \\times \\left( {0,T} \\right)\n\\tag{12.15}\\]\n\\[\n{\\sigma _{ij}}n_j^s =  - \\left\\{ {{p_0}({\\mathbf{x}}) + p({\\mathbf{x}},t)} \\right\\}n_i^s\\quad \\forall \\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},t} \\right) \\in \\Gamma _{fd}^s \\times \\left( {0,T} \\right)\n\\tag{12.16}\\]\nwhere \\(p_{0}(\\mathbf{x})\\) and \\(p(\\mathbf{x},t)\\) denote the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure due to impounded water in the reservoir, respectively, and \\(\\Gamma^{s}_{i,h}\\) denotes the portion of solid-boundary on which surface loads in \\(x_{i}\\)-direction are prescribed.\nLastly, the strong form of initial-boundary value problem of dynamic interaction between dam-reservoir system situated on a perfectly rigid ground is stated below. in Tip 12.1.",

In case no excitation source is present exterior to \\(\\Gamma^{f}_{\\infty}\\) the artificial boundary should be able to absorb the incoming waves. This is the case when vertical component of ground motion is absent.

    "text": "13.1 v-ST/FEM formulation\nThis chapter discusses the problem of dynamic interaction in a dam-reservoir-soil system subjected to the earthquake motion. Both dam and the underlying soil domain is assumed to be linearly elastic, and material damping can be modeled by Rayleigh damping. The water in the reservoir is assumed to be inviscid, linearly compressible with a small amplitudes for the displacements and velocity. Therefore, the hydrodynamic pressure in the reservoir is modeled by the pressure wave equation. Viscous boundary conditions are employed to truncate the semi-infinite domain of reservoir and underlying soil-domain. The space-time finite element formulation for coupled problem is described in terms of velocity field in the solid domain and the auxiliary variable \\(q\\) for the fluid domain, which denotes the first order time derivative of the hydrodynamic pressure field. Subsequently, a system of linearly coupled equations is obtained by the space-time finite element discretization of the weak form. The resultant system of linear equations is solved for the space-time nodal values of unknown fields \\(q\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) by using a two stage block-iterative scheme. Due to this scheme the size of the coupled-problem significantly decreases but at the cost of around 5 to 10 iterations per time steps. In each iteration step, first, a system of linear equations (which corresponds to the solid domain) is solved to compute the trial values of velocity field, and then the space-time nodal values of auxiliary variable \\(q\\) are computed by solving another system of linear equations (which corresponds to the fluid domain). The numerical performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by solving different types dam-reservoir interaction problems. The results obtained by the proposed scheme are successfully compared with results available in the literature.\nLastly, the response of a concrete gravity dam and reservoir with impounded water to the horizontal component of the earthquake motion is analyzed by using v-ST/FEM. Numerical simulations are performed for two cases; (i) DR, in which the interactions between the dam-reservoir and the underlying soil are ignored by assuming the ground to be perfectly rigid, (ii) DRS, in which the underlying soil domain is modeled as an isotropic, homogenous, linear elastic half space. Material damping in both dam and underlying soil domain is modeled by using Rayleigh damping. It is found that the dynamic interactions with the underlying deformable soil domain can significantly dampen the response of the dam-reservoir to the horizontal component of earthquake motion. The comparison of Fourier spectrum of acceleration response obtained for these two cases reveals an elongation of time period for DRS. In both cases, significant tensile stresses develop near the heel and at the downstream inclined face of the dam. The tensile and compressible stresses in the dam are much higher in case of DR than DRS. However, in both cases the tensile stress may exceed the ultimate tensile strength of the concrete which may cause cracking in the dam. Therefore, a nonlinear analysis of concrete gravity dam and reservoir system should be performed to evaluate the safety and performance of a specific dam design.\nLet \\(\\Omega^{f}_{h}\\), the set of finite spatial fluid-elements \\(\\Omega^{f}_{e}, e=1,\\cdots,n^{f}_{el}\\), be the discretization of reservoir domain \\(\\Omega^{f}\\), where \\(n^{f}_{el}\\) is the total number of spatial fluid elements in \\(\\Omega^{f}_{h}\\). Further, let \\(\\Omega^{s}_{h}\\), the set of finite spatial solid-elements \\(\\Omega^{s}_{e}\\), \\(e=1,\\cdots, n_{el}\\), be the discretization of solid domain \\(\\Omega^{s}\\), where \\(n_{el}\\) is the total number of spatial elements in \\(\\Omega_{h}\\).

    "text": "13.7 v-ST/FEM implementation\nIn case of dam-reservoir system, if rigid-ground motion contains the vertical movement then free-field hydrodynamic pressure \\(p^{f}\\) should be computed first in order to compute the total hydrodynamic pressure in the reservoir. The free-field response of reservoir is computed by solving a one-dimensional wave equation (cf. Equation 12.21) with appropriate boundary conditions (cf. Equation 12.22). Similarly, in case of dam-reservoir-soil system, the free-field response of soil-domain (\\(\\mathbf{u}^{f}, \\mathbf{v}^{f}, \\mathbf{\\sigma}^{f}\\)) and free-field response of reservoir (\\(p^{f},q^{f}\\)) is needed to compute the total response of dam-reservoir-soil system. Recalling that soil-column problem should be solved for determining the free-field response of soil-domain.\nIn a given time step (i.e., \\(I_{n}=(t_{n}, t_{n+1})\\)), once the space-time nodal values of (\\(\\mathbf{u}^{f}, \\mathbf{v}^{f}, \\mathbf{\\sigma}^{f}\\)) on \\(\\Gamma^{L}_{\\infty}\\cup\\Gamma^{R}_{\\infty}\\cup\\Gamma^{B}_{\\infty}\\) and (\\(p^{f},q^{f}\\)) on \\(\\Gamma^{f}_{\\infty}\\) are determined the total response of reservoir (in the form of primary unknown \\(q\\)), and the total velocity field for the solid-domain \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) can be computed by solving the linear system of coupled-equations; Equation 13.27, Equation 13.28, for the dam-reservoir (DR) system, and Equation 13.34, Equation 13.35 for the dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system. Here it is important to note that the primary unknowns to be determined are \\({q}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). Further, it is possible to solve the coupled-equations simultaneously, however, this implementation strategy is undesirable as the number of unknowns increases drastically. Therefore, a block-iterative algorithm is devised to solve the system of coupled-equations given by Equation 13.27, Equation 13.28 or Equation 13.34, Equation 13.35 iteratively. In this strategy the solution of the coupled system can be obtained by solving the two systems (fluid domain and solid domain) separately with interaction effects enforced by iteration. The major advantage of this approach is that coupled field problems can be handled in a sequential manner.

Let the space-time nodal values of \\(q\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in \\(k^{th}\\) iteration be denoted by \\({\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( k \\right)}}\\) and \\({\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( k \\right)}}\\), respectively. The block-iterative algorithm for solving the Equation 13.41 and Equation 13.42 can be described as\n\\[\n\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^s} \\right] \\cdot {\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( k \\right)}} = \\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{J}}^s}} \\right\\} - \\left[ {{\\mathbf{H}}_{}^s} \\right] \\cdot {\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( {k - 1} \\right)}}{\\text{ }}\n\\tag{13.45}\\]\n\\[\n\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^f} \\right] \\cdot {\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( k \\right)}} = \\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{J}}^f}} \\right\\} - \\left[ {{\\mathbf{H}}_{}^f} \\right] \\cdot {\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( k \\right)}}\n\\tag{13.46}\\]\nThe proposed block-iterative scheme can be viewed as a two-stage iterative algorithm in which the analysis is carried out for each field (\\(q\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)) and interaction effect is accommodated by updating the variables of the fields in the respective coupling terms. In first-stage, see Equation 13.45, \\({\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( {k - 1} \\right)}}\\) is utilized to compute the velocity field \\({\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( {k - 1} \\right)}}\\) in the solid-domain. At this stage, one can start by setting \\(q\\) to be zero, that is \\({\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( 0 \\right)}}=\\mathbf{0}\\). After computing the trial value of velocity field \\({\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( k \\right)}}\\), the trial displacement of solid domain at time \\(t=t_{n+1}\\) is computed by using the relation given in Equation 13.21.\n\\[\n{\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde u}}}^2}} \\right\\}^{\\left( k \\right)}} = \\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde u}}}^1}} \\right\\} + \\frac{{\\Delta {t_n}}}{2}\\left( {{{\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}}^1}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}} + {{\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}}^2}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}}} \\right)\n\\tag{13.47}\\]\nwhere \\(\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde u}}}^1}} \\right\\}\\) denotes the space-nodal values of displacement field at time \\(t=t_{n}\\), and \\(\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde u}}}^1}} \\right\\}^{(k)}\\) denotes the trial space-nodal values of displacement field at time \\(t=t_{n+1}\\).\nIn second-stage, see Equation 13.46, the velocity field \\({\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( {k} \\right)}}\\) is used for computing the \\({\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}^{\\left( {k} \\right)}}\\). Subsequently, the space-nodal values of hydrodynamic-pressure at time \\(t=t_{n+1}\\) is computed by employing the Equation 13.26.\n\\[\n{\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde p}}}^2}} \\right\\}^{\\left( k \\right)}} = \\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde p}}}^1}} \\right\\} + \\frac{{\\Delta {t_n}}}{2}\\left( {{{\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}}^1}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}} + {{\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}}^2}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}}} \\right)\n\\tag{13.48}\\]\nwhere \\(\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde p}}}^1}} \\right\\}\\) denotes the space-nodal values of hydrodynamic pressure in reservoir at time \\(t=t_{n}\\), and \\(\\left\\{ {{{{\\mathbf{\\tilde p}}}^2}} \\right\\}\\) denotes the trial space-nodal values of pressure field at time \\(t=t_{n+1}\\).\nIn each iteration step, after computing trial values of \\(q\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), convergence of sequences formed by the trial space-time nodal values \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}^{(k)}\\) and \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}^{(k)}\\) should be checked. In present study following convergence criterion has been adopted\n\\[\n\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}}} \\right\\| - \\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( {k - 1} \\right)}}} \\right\\| \\leqslant {\\epsilon_q}\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( 0 \\right)}}} \\right\\|\n\\tag{13.49}\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}}} \\right\\| - \\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( {k - 1} \\right)}}} \\right\\| \\leqslant {\\epsilon_v}\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( 0 \\right)}}} \\right\\|\n\\tag{13.50}\\]\nin which \\(\\epsilon_{q}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{v}\\) denote the tolerance for convergence in \\(q\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), respectively. \\(\\left\\| {\\cdot} \\right\\|\\) denotes Euclidean norm of space-time vectors. Note that Equation 13.49 and Equation 13.50 define the local convergence criterion for the sequence \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde q}}} \\right\\}^{(k)}\\) and \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}^{(k)}\\), respectively. The global convergence is defined when both Equation 13.49 and Equation 13.50 are true. In this way, for any given time-step, iterations are performed until global convergence is achieved.\nNote that in Equation 13.45 and Equation 13.46 the space-time nodal vectors \\(\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{J}}^s}} \\right\\}\\) and \\(\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{J}}^f}} \\right\\}\\), and the space-time matrices \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^s} \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^f} \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{H}}_{}^s} \\right]\\) and \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{H}}_{}^f} \\right]\\) remain fixed during the iteration in a given time-step. Therefore, aforesaid space-time vectors and matrices only need to be computed once in the beginning of the iteration for a given time-step. Further, if a uniform time-step size \\(\\Delta t_{n} = \\Delta t, \\forall n=0,N-1\\) is employed then the space-time matrices need to be computed only once for all the time-step. Furthermore, the space-time tangent matrix \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^s} \\right]\\) in Equation 13.45 and \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^f} \\right]\\) in Equation 13.46 yield unsymmetrical system of linear equations. These linear equations are solved by using GpBiCG algorithm (Zhang 1997). The algorithm is implemented in an element by element manner thus avoiding the assembly of global space-time tangent matrix. Lastly, the complete procedure to solve the problem of dynamic interaction of dam-reservoir system and dam-reservoir-soil system is given in Tip 13.1.",

Further, in order to evaluated the effectiveness of the viscous (or Sommerfeld) boundary condition (cf.

Figure 13.4 shows the time history of the normalized hydrodynamic pressures 1 at the base of the dam for different values of the reservoir lengths. It can be observed that as the length of the reservoir increases the difference between computed and analytical solution decreases. In Figure 13.4, it is remarkable that the peak value of hydrodynamic pressure is attained during the first cycle of pressure wave, and in all cases the first cycle of hydrodynamic pressure wave is predicted correctly. In addition, for smaller values of \\(L/H\\) the increase in the amplitude of the pressure fluctuations and shortening of time period occurs much earlier than that for large values of \\(L/H\\).\nFigure 13.5 compares the distribution of the maximum hydrodynamic pressure on the upstream face of the rigid-dam for all \\(L/H\\) values with the analytical solution. Interestingly, in all cases the distribution of maximum hydrodynamic pressure on the vertical face of rigid-dam is in good agreement with the analytical result. This is because the maximum pressure at any point on the face of the dam occurs during the first half cycle of pressure wave, and from Figure 13.4 it can be seen that, for all values of \\(L/H\\) ratio, the computed peak hydrodynamic pressure is nearly same as the analytical result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: Comparison of hydrodynamic pressure at the base of rigid dam due to ramp acceleration for \\(L/H=3\\) with the analytical solution of Tsai, Lee, and Ketter (1990) and the finite element solution of Pelecanos, Kontoe, and Zdravković (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: Comparison of hydrodynamic pressure at the base of rigid dam due to ramp acceleration for \\(L/H=7\\) with the analytical solution of Tsai, Lee, and Ketter (1990) and the finite element solution of Pelecanos, Kontoe, and Zdravković (2013)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6 and Figure 13.7 compare the hydrodynamic pressures computed by v-ST/FEM approach at the base of the rigid dam for \\(L/H=3\\) and \\(L/H=7\\) with both the analytical solution given by Equation 13.51 and the finite element solution obtained by (Pelecanos, Kontoe, and Zdravković 2013). It can be observed that results obtained from present approach are nearly identical to the finite element results of (Pelecanos, Kontoe, and Zdravković 2013), which implies that the discrepancy between the analytical solutions and the computed results is mainly due to the viscous boundary condition given by Equation 12.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Hydrodynamic pressure field in the reservoir of length \\(L=3H\\), \\(L=5H\\), and \\(L=7H\\), computed by using v-ST/FEM at time \\(t=0.19\\) seconds due to ramp acceleration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: Hydrodynamic pressure field in the reservoir of length \\(L=3H\\), \\(L=5H\\), and \\(L=7H\\), computed by using v-ST/FEM at time \\(t=1.60\\) seconds due to ramp acceleration\n\n\n\nLastly, the hydrodynamic pressure fields in the reservoir of length, \\(L=3H\\), \\(L=5H\\), and \\(L=7H\\), computed by using v-ST/FEM approach at time \\(t=0.19\\)s and \\(t=1.6\\)s are given in Figure 13.8 and Figure 13.9, respectively. At time \\(t=0.19\\)s, the spatial variation of pressure field in the reservoir of different lengths is almost identical. At time \\(t=1.6\\)s, however, the hydrodynamic pressure in the reservoir of smaller length is more than the hydrodynamic pressure in reservoir of the larger length. This is because, the viscous boundary condition (cf. Equation 12.6), especially in case of small-length reservoir, is inadequate for perfectly absorbing the impinging pressure waves. Consequently, some fraction of incident energy will be reflected back into the truncated reservoir domain, which in turn will amplify the hydrodynamic pressure waves in the truncated reservoir domain.",

    "text": "13.11 Concrete gravity dam\nIn this section the dynamic response of a concrete gravity dam subjected to the horizontal component of earthquake motion is computed by using the v-ST/FEM approach. Numerical simulations are performed for following two situations,\n\nDam-reservoir system (DR): In this case, the unbounded soil domain underneath the dam-reservoir system is assumed to be rigid, therefore neglecting the interaction between dam-reservoir system and the underlying foundation. The dam-reservoir interaction is modeled by the discretizing the dam and reservoir domain using finite elements.\nDam-reservoir-soil system (DRS): In this case, all interactions of dam-reservoir-soil system are considered. The fluid domain and unbounded soil domain are truncated by using the viscous boundaries.\n\nThe physical dimensions of the dam and reservoir are given in Figure 13.14. The height of the vertical upstream face of the dam is \\(50\\) m, and the width of the base is \\(40\\) m. The spatial domain of dam is discretized by using \\(658\\) number of three-node triangular (Tria3) finite elements (see Figure 13.15). Further, it is assumed that the depth of water in the reservoir, \\(H^f\\), remains constant at value \\(44\\) m. The computation domain for the semi-infinite reservoir is obtained by placing a viscous boundary at a distance of \\(200\\) m from the dam in the upstream direction. Finite element mesh of the reservoir consists of \\(1144\\) number of four-node rectangular (Quad4) finite elements (see Figure 13.15). Similarly, the unbounded soil domain is truncated by using the horizontal and vertical viscous boundaries; the length of the soil domain in \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) direction is \\(440\\) m and \\(150\\) m, respectively. Finite element mesh of the soil domain which contains \\(6448\\) number of four-node rectangular finite elements is depicted in Figure 13.15. In finite element modeling of unbounded soil domain, the free field responses of the soil domain are obtained by using the soil-columns (with constrained vertical motion) placed next to the vertical artificial boundaries, and the effective seismic input is described in terms of traction boundary condition at the bottom truncated boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.14: Physical dimensions of the concrete gravity dam and reservoir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.15: Finite element mesh of reservoir-domain (top-left), dam-domain (top-right), and soil-domain (bottom)\n\n\n\nIt is assumed that the material behavior of dam as well as the soil is given by an isotropic, homogenous, linear elastic stress-strain relationship. For the concrete-dam, the elastic modulus \\(E=28.0\\)GPa, mass-density \\(\\rho=2347.0\\) kg/m \\({}^3\\), and the Poisson’s ratio \\(\\nu=0.20\\). For the soil, \\(E=40.0\\)GPa, \\(\\rho=2551.0\\) kg/m\\({}^3\\), and \\(\\nu=0.20\\). Further, material damping is modeled by Rayleigh damping with \\(\\xi=5\\%\\) viscous damping specified for the soil and dam separately. The resultant values of damping coefficients \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) for the dam and soil are given by \\((4.1314, 4.8\\times10^{-4})\\) and \\((1.612, 1.47\\times10^{-3})\\), respectively. The speed of acoustic wave in water is \\(c = 1439\\) m/s, and the water is assumed to be inviscid and compressible with a mass density of \\(1000\\) kg/m\\({}^3\\). The wave reflection coefficient \\(\\alpha_b\\) for reservoir bottom is taken as unity (i.e., reservoir bottom acts as a perfect reflector for the pressure waves).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.16: Horizontal component of ground motion recorded at the free-surface: (A) time history, and (B) Fourier spectrum\n\n\n\nThe simulations are carried out for the horizontal component of the earthquake motion recorded at some control point on the free surface (see Figure 13.14). Total time duration of ground motion is \\(45\\) seconds in which acceleration is set to zero after \\(40\\) seconds. Figure 13.16 a depicts the time history of the earthquake motion; the maximum and minimum values of acceleration are \\(396.7\\)cm/s\\({}^{2}\\) and \\(-449.6\\)cm/s\\({}^{2}\\), respectively. The Fourier spectrum of acceleration is plotted in Figure 13.16 b; the dominating dominating amplitudes \\(21.9\\) cm/s\\({}^{2}\\) and \\(19.4\\)cm/s\\({}^{2}\\) occur at frequencies \\(1.24\\) Hz and \\(2.0\\)Hz, respectively. It is worthwhile to mention that in the case of dam-reservoir system (DR), the earthquake motion plotted in Figure 13.14 is directly used as a boundary condition at the base of concrete-dam. On the other hand, for numerical simulation of DS and DRS the input seismic acceleration is taken as half that of acceleration at the free surface. All numerical simulations are performed with a uniform time step size \\(\\Delta t = 0.01\\) s for total time duration of \\(40\\) seconds. The initial value of displacement and stress field is obtained by solving corresponding static problem. The convergence tolerance for \\(q\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in block iterative algorithm are set to \\(0.01\\%\\). The resultant unsymmetrical system of linear equation is solved by using the GpBiCG algorithm with tolerance value of \\(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.17: Acceleration response at the crest of the concrete-dam (Node-2) to horizontal component of earthquake motion for the case of dam-reservoir (DR) and dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system: (A) time history of horizontal component of acceleration, (B) time history of vertical component of acceleration, (C) Fourier spectrum of horizontal component of acceleration, (D) Fourier spectrum of vertical component of acceleration\n\n\n\nLet us now focus on the effect of interaction between dam-reservoir system (with impounded water) and the underlying soil-domain on the response of dam to horizontal component of the earthquake motion. For this purpose the results obtained in the case of DR (where the underlying soil is modeled as rigid foundation) and DRS (in which underlying soil is modeled as flexible foundation) are compared.\nThe acceleration response at the crest of the concrete-dam (Node-2) obtained in the case of DR and DRS is plotted in Figure 13.17. The acceleration response obtained in case of DRS is significantly lower than the one obtained in case of DR. In case of DRS the absolute maximum value of horizontal and vertical component of acceleration is \\(1489.89\\) Gal and \\(597.47\\) Gal, respectively, whereas for DR these values correspond to \\(3897.10\\) Gal and \\(1274.65\\) Gal, respectively. Fourier spectrum of the acceleration response at the crest of the dam reveals that for DRS there is significant decay in the amplitudes, and the entire spectrum shifts towards the lower frequencies indicating the elongation of time period in acceleration time history (see Figure 13.17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.18: Time history of hydrodynamic pressure at the base of the dam subjected to horizontal component of earthquake motion for the case of dam-reservoir (DR) and dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system\n\n\n\nThe effect of neglecting the interaction between dam-reservoir system and the underlying soil on the hydrodynamic pressure at the base of the concrete-dam is illustrated in Figure 13.18. It can be observed that the assumption of rigid foundation leads to an amplification of hydrodynamic pressure at upstream face of the concrete dam. The reservoir-soil interaction also alter the hydrodynamic pressure distribution in the reservoir domain as shown in Figure 13.19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.19: Hydrodynamic pressure distribution in the reservoir at different times due to horizontal component of earthquake motion for the case of dam-reservoir (DR) and dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system\n\n\n\nThe temporal variation of the maximum and minimum principal stress, \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) respectively, at the base of the dam (which corresponds to the Gauss point of triangular Element-A), which is given in see Figure 13.20, indicates that the incomprehension of the dynamic interaction between underlying soil and structure may cause large compressive and tensile stresses in the dam. In Figure 13.20, the peak value of \\(\\sigma_1\\) and \\(\\sigma_2\\) for DRS is given by \\(2.24\\) MPa and \\(-3.09\\) MPa, respectively, whereas for DR these values are given by \\(6.08\\) MPa and \\(-5.97\\) MPa, respectively. In both cases, tensile stress at the base of the dam may exceed the ultimate tensile strength of the concrete, which may cause cracking in the concrete-dam. Further, the stress distribution inside the dam obtained in the case of DR and DRS differs significantly from each other as shown in Figure 13.21. In both cases, however, large tensile stresses develop near the heel of the dam and at the downstream inclined face of the dam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.20: Time history of maximum (A) and minimum (B) principal stress at the base of the dam (Element-A) subjected to horizontal component of earthquake motion for the case of dam-reservoir (DR) and dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.21: Spatial distribution of maximum principal stress \\(\\sigma_1\\) in the concrete dam subjected to horizontal component of earthquake motion for the case of dam-reservoir (DR) and dam-reservoir-soil (DRS) system. In DR underlying foundation is rigid, and in DRS the foundation is flexible\n\n\n\nBased on the results obtained in this section, it may be concluded that interactions between the dam-reservoir and the underlying soil significantly decay the response of concrete-dam reservoir system to the horizontal component of the ground motion. This is because for DR radiation of energy can occur only through the upstream artificial truncated boundary of the reservoir domain, and the pressure and displacement waves impinging the rigid-foundation are completely reflected back into the dam-reservoir domain, which is responsible for the amplification of the response. On the other hand, in case of DRS the flexible foundation provides additional mechanisms for the radiation of energy through the soil strata, which in turn reduces the overall response of the dam-reservoir system.\n\n\n\n\nKüçükarslan, S., S.

    "text": "14.1 Introduction\nIn previous chapters linear dynamic problems are solved by using v-ST/FEM. In Chapter [ch:ch6], linear dynamic analysis of gravity dam subjected to the earthquake ground motion show that the large tensile stresses may develop in dam which can exceed the tensile strength of the mass concrete. In such cases, a linear analysis is no longer valid since tensile cracks will form and propagates in the concrete, affecting the vibration properties an dynamic response of the dam. Consequently, cracking based on seismic actions in dams is an important factor in the safety evaluation of gravity dams and it may cause catastrophic consequences such as loss of life and property if the dam fails.\nExtensive research has been performed over the last 25 years into the fracture behavior of concrete. A tensile-strength-based crack propagation analysis is generally considered unreliable due to the mesh-dependent response prediction (Bažant 1987). Non-linear behavior in the fracture process zone (FPZ), which is significantly large for the concrete normally used in dams, is neglected in the conventional linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) models. Under very slowly applied loads and also under impulsive loads, concrete fracture behavior seems to be adequately predicted by the LEFM models (Bhattacharjee and Leger 1993). In the intermediate range, from short-term static loading to seismic-induced strain rates, non-linear fracture mechanics (NLFM) models considering the strain softening behavior in the FPZ appear to be more appropriate.\nContinuum mechanics approaches to represent the tensile crack propagation are computationally very attractive for applications in complex structural analysis when the crack profiles are not known a priori. General drawbacks of the conventional smeared crack analysis model, such as the mesh-sensitive response prediction and the stress-locking in finite elements, can largely be overcome using the energy conserving co-axial rotating crack model (CRCM), which is an improved NLFM model (Bhattacharjee and Leger 1993).\n(Bhattacharjee and Leger 1993) investigated the dynamic fracture response of Koyna dam by using the CRCM concrete model. In the analysis of this dam, the foundation was assumed to be rigid, and the dynamic interaction of dam-reservoir system was modeled by the Westergaard added mass technique. The response results of the dam indicated that cracks formed at the base and at the upper portion near the change in downstream slope for the Koyna earthquake records. (Lee and Fenves 1998) also obtained similar solutions for Koyna dam under the same boundary and loading conditions by using a plastic-damage concrete model which includes tension and compression strain softening effects. They studied in detail tension damage in the dam and noted that damage in compression is less important in comparison with damage in tension for dams. In another paper, (Cervera, Oliver, and Faria 1995) developed an isotropic damage model for the seismic evaluation of concrete gravity and arch dams. This model accounts for the different behavior of concrete in tension and compression by splitting the stress tensor into tensile and compressive components, each with its own damage surface and evolution law. The seismic analyses of their selected gravity dam which resembles very closely Koyna dam, including dam-reservoir-foundation interactions, subjected to artificially generated earthquakes of different intensities indicated tension damage in the dam, but no compression damage occurred. The formed tension damage was seen at the upper portion of the dam. In the lights of these investigations, the tension cracks have only important influence on the seismic response of concrete gravity dams. Therefore, tension cracking is only considered in the present study.\nIn this chapter, v-ST/FEM is employed for the problems involving dynamic response of solids and structures with nonlinear stress-strain relationships. The structure of the present chapter is described as follows. First, we will define the problem of dynamic interaction between the concrete gravity dam and reservoir, in which a generalized nonlinear stress-strain relationship is used to describe the material behavior of concrete in the dam. Then we will discuss the space-time weak form of the model problem. , It is shown that the nonlinearity is caused by only the presence of stress term in the v-ST/FEM weak form. Subsequently, two v-ST/FEM schemes are proposed for the time integration of the space-time nodal vectors and matrices comprising the stress term. This chapter also presents a block-iterative scheme to enforce the coupling between the solid and fluid domain. Finally, the numerical results of the nonlinear dynamic analysis of a concrete gravity dam subjected to the earthquake ground motion are presented and discussed.",

    "text": "14.2 Statement of problem\nFigure 12.2 depicts the dam-reservoir system situated on a relatively rigid ground which is subjected to the spatially uniform transient ground motion. The horizontal and vertical component of ground motion are denoted by \\(a_{1}^{g}(t)\\) and \\(a_{2}^{g}(t)\\), respectively. Henceforth, the superscript \\({(\\cdot)}^{s}\\) and \\({(\\cdot)}^{f}\\) will be used for denoting the quantities related to the solid (dam) and fluid domain, respectively. Let \\(\\Omega^{f}\\) be the computation domain of reservoir which is enclosed by a free surface \\(\\Gamma_{f}^{f}\\), an upstream artificial boundary \\(\\Gamma_{\\infty}^{f}\\), a fluid-soil interface \\(\\Gamma^{f}_{fs}\\), and a fluid-dam interface \\(\\Gamma_{fd}^{f}\\). Accordingly, the boundary of the fluid domain can be described by\n\\[\n\\Gamma_{}^f = \\Gamma_f^f \\cup \\Gamma_\\infty^f \\cup \\Gamma _{fs}^f \\cup \\Gamma_{fd}^f\n\\tag{14.1}\\]\nLet \\(\\Omega^{s}\\) be the computation domain of dam, \\(\\Gamma_{fd}^{s}\\) be the fluid-dam interface of dam, and \\(\\Gamma_{ds}^{s}\\) be the base of the dam. The outward unit normal vectors to the fluid and solid boundary are denoted by \\(\\mathbf{n}^{s}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{n}^{f}\\), respectively, and\n\\[\n{{\\mathbf{n}}^s} + {{\\mathbf{n}}^f} = {\\mathbf{0}}\n\\tag{14.2}\\]\nSince the ground underneath the dam, which is in spatially uniform motion, is assumed to be perfectly-rigid it is advantageous to describe the motion of the dam relative to the ground. Let \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) be the relative displacements and relative velocities of the dam, respectively, and \\(\\rho^{s}\\) be the mass-density of the dam. The governing equation of motion for the dam becomes,\n\\[\n{\\rho ^s}\\frac{{\\partial {v_i}}}{{\\partial t}} - \\frac{{\\partial {\\sigma _{ij}}}}{{\\partial {x_j}}} = {\\rho ^s}\\left( {{b_i} - a_i^g} \\right) \\quad \\forall ({\\mathbf{x}},t) \\in {\\Omega ^s} \\times (0,T)\n\\tag{14.3}\\]\nwhere \\(b_{i}\\) is the external body force density, and \\(-\\rho^{s}\\mathbf{a}^{g}(t)\\) is the pseudo force acting on the dam due to the accelerating frame of reference. The above equation can be derived from the Equation 12.10 while noting that the spatial gradient of ground motion is zero.

Equation 14.16, \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) denotes the relative velocity of the dam with respect to the base of the dam. In Equation 14.17, \\(q_{c}\\) is the damping coefficient which is the fundamental parameter characterizing the effect of reservoir bottom materials and it is given in (Fenves and Chopra 1983) as,\n\\[\n{q_c} = \\frac{{1 - {\\alpha_{b}}}}{{c\\left( {1 + {\\alpha_{b}}} \\right)}}\n\\tag{14.18}\\]\nin which, \\(\\alpha_{b}\\) is the ratio of the amplitude of reflected hydrodynamic pressure wave to the amplitude of a vertically propagating pressure wave incident on the reservoir bottom.\nNote that the governing equation for the fluid domain, which is given by Equation 14.11, remains linear for both \\(p\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). This equation is identical to the one presented in the last chapter. The governing equation for the solid domain (i.e. dam), which is given by Equation 14.3, is nonlinear due to the nonlinear stress-strain relationship. However, this equation is linear in hydrodynamic pressure acting on the dam-fluid interface (see boundary condition given by Equation 14.7. The linearity of Equation 14.3 in \\(p\\) and Equation 14.11 in \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) implies the linear coupling between fluid and solid domain.",

    "text": "14.3 A nonlinear smeared crack model for concrete material\nMaterials such as concrete, mortar, and rocks have very less tensile strength (about 10 percent) than compressive strength and exhibit a quasi-brittle behavior. Tensile fracture in concrete like materials involves progressive micro-cracking, tortuous debonding and other processes of internal damage which eventually coalesce into a macro-cracks. Accordingly, a mass concrete when subjected to the tensile loading undergo strain softening before leading to a complete loss of strength. Figure 14.1 shows a typical stress-strain relationship for mass concrete from uniaxial tension test obtained by (Brühwiler 1990). At the beginning, a linear relationship between stress and strain exists until the elastic limit is reached. Once the elastic limit is crossed, micro-cracks develop within the mass concrete, which results in nonlinearity in the curve up to the ultimate tensile strength \\(\\sigma_{t}\\). The post-peak behavior starts with the strain-softening due to growth of micro-cracks in the weakest cross-section of the specimen which then coalescence into a crack: a geometrical discontinuity that separates the material. Therefore, the stress-strain relationship for the concrete like materials can be divided into two regime: (i) pre-softening regime and (ii) softening regime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: Typical stress-strain curve for mass concrete from simple tension test after (Brühwiler 1990)\n\n\n\nIn what follows the co-axially rotating crack model (CRCM)1 which is defined by (i) the pre-softening material behavior, (ii) the criterion for crack initiation, (iii) the fracture energy conservation, and (iv) the growth, closing and reopening of cracks, and v-ST/FEM implementation of this constitutive model are presented.\n\n14.3.1 Pre-softening behavior\nThe stress-strain relationship at a material point is given by\n\\[\n\\left\\{ \\sigma  \\right\\} = \\left[ {\\mathbf{C}} \\right] \\cdot \\left\\{ \\varepsilon  \\right\\}\n\\tag{14.19}\\]\nwhere \\(\\left[ {\\mathbf{C}} \\right]\\), \\(\\left\\{ \\sigma  \\right\\} = \\left[ {{\\sigma_{11}},{\\sigma_{22}},{\\sigma_{12}}} \\right]\\) and \\(\\left\\{ \\varepsilon  \\right\\} = \\left[ {{\\varepsilon_{11}},{\\varepsilon_{22}},2{\\varepsilon_{12}}} \\right]\\) denotes Voigt-form of the constitutive matrix, stress tensor and strain tensor, respectively. In pre-softening case since there are no cracks developed in concrete, the standard elastic plane stress-strain matrix for an isotropic material is used. Then, the matrix\n\\(\\left[ {\\mathbf{C}} \\right]\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\left[ {\\mathbf{C}} \\right] = \\frac{E_{0}}{{1 - {\\nu ^2}}}\\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  1&\\nu &0 \\\\\n  \\nu &1&0 \\\\\n  0&0&{\\frac{{1 - \\nu }}{2}}\n\\end{array}} \\right]\n\\tag{14.20}\\]\nwhere \\(\\nu\\) is the Poisson’s ratio, and \\(E_{0}\\) is the modulus of elasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2: Constitutive modeling for nonlinear smeared crack analysis. (a) Idealized stress-strain curve for concrete; (b) biaxial stress effect in the strain softening initiation; (c) local axis system; (d) closing and reopening of cracks.\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3.2 Crack initiation criterion\nThe stress-strain relationship for concrete becomes non-linear near the peak strength as shown in Figure 14.2 . In the post-peak strain softening phase, coalescence of the micro-cracks causes a gradual reduction of the stress resistance. The area under the uniaxial stress-strain curve up to the peak, defined in Equation 14.19, is taken as the index for softening initiation:\n\\[\n{U_0} = \\frac{1}{2}{\\sigma _t}{\\varepsilon _0}=\\frac{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}{2E_{0}}\n\\tag{14.21}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{t}\\) is the uniaxial tensile strength of mass concrete, \\(\\varepsilon_{0}\\) is the corresponding strain threshold, \\(E_{0}\\) is the modulus of elasticity. In the plane-stress finite element analyses, the crack initiation criterion is given by (Bhattacharjee and Leger 1993; Calayir and Karaton 2005)\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}{\\sigma_{1}\\varepsilon_{1}} \\ge U_{0}\n\\tag{14.22}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) and \\(\\varepsilon_{1}\\) are the maximum principal stress and strain, respectively. In above equation the term \\((\\sigma_{1}\\varepsilon_{1}/2)\\) denotes the tensile strain energy density. Accordingly, the biaxial effect in the crack initiation criterion may be given by\n\\[\n\\sigma_{1} \\ge \\frac{\\sigma_{t}^{2}}{E_{0} \\varepsilon_{1}}\\quad\n\\text{or} \\quad\n\\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{\\sigma_{t}} \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{1}}{E_{0}\\varepsilon_{1}}}\n\\tag{14.23}\\]\nThis equation represents a biaxial failure envelope which is illustrated in Figure 14.2 It can be observed that strain softening occurs for tension-tension and tension-compression stress states due to tension cracking, however, no cracks develop under compression-compression stress state.\n\n\n14.3.3 Strain softening model for concrete and fracture energy conservation\n(Bhattacharjee and Leger 1993) used a linear strain softening relationship; the tensile resistance of concrete is assumed to decrease linearly from the pre-softening undamaged state to the fully damaged state of zero tensile resistance. Recently, numerous researchers have shown that it is more realistic to assume a strain softening curve with a steep initial decline followed by an extended tail (Kurumatani et al. 2016; Geers, De Borst, and Peerlings 2000; Jirasek and Grassl 2008; Giry, Dufour, and Mazars 2011; Peerlings et al. 1998; Calayir and Karaton 2005). According to (Calayir and Karaton 2005), the post-peak strain softening behavior of concrete can be modeled by using following exponential strain softening relationship (see also Figure 14.2 a)\n\\[\n\\sigma \\left( \\varepsilon  \\right) = \\left\\{ \\begin{gathered}\n  {E_0}\\varepsilon ,\\quad \\varepsilon  \\leqslant {\\varepsilon _0} \\\\\n  {\\sigma _t}\\left[ {2{e^{ - a\\left( {\\varepsilon  - {\\varepsilon _0}} \\right)}} - {e^{ - 2a\\left( {\\varepsilon  - {\\varepsilon _0}} \\right)}}} \\right],\\quad {\\varepsilon _0} &lt; \\varepsilon  &lt; {\\varepsilon _{cr}} \\\\\n  0,\\qquad \\varepsilon  \\geqslant {\\varepsilon _{cr}} \\\\\n\\end{gathered}  \\right.\n\\tag{14.24}\\]\nwhere \\(\\varepsilon_{cr}\\) denotes the maximum strain that may not be exceeded during strain softening, and is consistent with the study carried out by (Bažant 1987). The value of \\(\\varepsilon_{cr}\\) can be calculated when its corresponding stress given is equal to \\(\\delta_{cr} \\sigma_{t}\\). Thus, \\(\\sigma = \\delta_{cr} \\sigma_{t}\\) in Equation 14.24 b one can expressed \\(\\varepsilon\\) as\n\\[\n{\\varepsilon _{cr}} = {\\varepsilon _0} + \\frac{1}{a}\\ln \\left( {\\frac{{1 + \\sqrt {1 - {\\delta _{cr}}} }}{{{\\delta _{cr}}}}} \\right)\n\\tag{14.25}\\]\nIn this study \\(\\delta_{cr}=0.02\\), therefore, \\({\\varepsilon _{cr}}\\) is given by\n\\[\n{\\varepsilon _{cr}}={\\varepsilon _{0}} + \\frac{4.6}{a}\n\\tag{14.26}\\]\nIn Equation 14.24, Equation 14.25, Equation 14.26 \\(a\\) is a dimensionless parameter which is related to the slope of the softening curve. The parameter \\(a\\) should be adjusted such that the energy dissipation for a unit area of crack plane propagation is conserved. Let the fracture energy2 be denoted by \\(G_{f}\\). In the energy balance approach it is assumed that the fracture energy \\(G_{f}\\) will be absorbed due to formation of a unit area of crack surface. When the crack propagates a certain amount of stored energy is released, and the crack can only propagates when the released energy is equal to or greater than the absorbed energy (Hillerborg, Modéer, and Petersson 1976). The limiting value of \\(a\\) can be obtained b,\n\\[\n\\int_0^\\infty  {\\sigma d\\varepsilon } : = \\int_0^{{\\varepsilon _0}} {\\sigma d\\varepsilon }  + \\int_{{\\varepsilon _0}}^\\infty  {\\sigma d\\varepsilon }  = \\frac{{{G_f}}}{{{l_{ch}}}}\n\\tag{14.27}\\]\nNow, use of the stress-strain relationship as given by Equation 14.24 in above equation will yield following expression for \\(a\\).\n\\[\na = \\frac{3}{{{\\varepsilon _o}\\left( {\\frac{{2{G_f}}}{{{l_{ch}}{\\sigma _t}{\\varepsilon _o}}} - 1} \\right)}} \\geqslant 0\n\\tag{14.28}\\]\nIn Equation 14.27 and Equation 14.28, \\(l_{ch}\\) is a geometrical constant which is introduced as a measure of the length of fracture processing zone in mass concrete. In two-dimensional finite element analyses, \\(l_{ch}\\) can be calculated by using the relations given below (Kurumatani et al. 2016),\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\text{Triangular element:}& l_{ch} = \\sqrt{2A_{e}}\n\\\\\n\\text{Quadrilateral element:}& l_{ch} = \\sqrt{A_{e}}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{14.29}\\]\nin which \\(A_{e}\\) denotes the area of a two-dimensional finite element.\n\n\n14.3.4 Constitutive relationship during softening\nAfter the softening initiation, a smeared band of micro-cracks is assumed to appear in the direction normal to the principal the tensile stress. The axes of principal stresses rotates during the cracking. In a co-axially rotating crack model (CRCM), the axes of principal stress and strain are allowed to rotate during or after cracking while assuming stress and strain to be coaxial (Rots, 1991; Bhattacharjee and Leger, 1993; Calayir and Karaton, 2005). The material reference axis system, referred to as the local axis system, is aligned with the principal strain directions (direction \\(n-s\\) in Figure 14.2 c). The constitutive matrix relating the local stresses to local strains is defined as\n\\[\n\\left[ {{{\\mathbf{C}}_{ns}}} \\right] = \\frac{{{E_0}}}{{1 - \\eta {\\nu ^2}}}\\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  \\eta &{\\nu \\eta }&0 \\\\\n  {\\eta \\nu }&1&0 \\\\\n  0&0&{\\mu \\frac{{1 - \\eta {\\nu ^2}}}{{2\\left( {1 + \\nu } \\right)}}}\n\\end{array}} \\right]\n; \\quad \\eta = \\frac{E_{n}}{E_{0}}\n\\tag{14.30}\\]\nwhere \\(\\eta \\in [0,1]\\) is the ratio of the softened elastic modulus (\\(E_{n}\\)) in the direction normal to the fracture plane to the initial isotropic elastic modulus (\\(E_{0}\\)), thus \\(\\eta\\) denotes the damaged state of the material; \\(\\eta=1\\) implies undamaged state and \\(\\eta=0\\) implies a fully damaged state. In this equation, \\(\\mu\\) is the shear resistance factor defined for the CRCM as follows:\n\\[\n\\mu  = \\frac{{1 + \\nu }}{{1 - \\eta {\\nu ^2}}}\\left( {\\frac{{\\eta {\\varepsilon _n} - {\\varepsilon _s}}}{{{\\varepsilon _n} - {\\varepsilon _s}}} - \\eta \\nu } \\right),\\qquad \\mu  \\in \\left[ {0,1} \\right]\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\varepsilon_{n}\\) is the maximum principal strain,\n\\({\\varepsilon_{s} } = \\max \\left( {{\\varepsilon_{1}},{\\varepsilon_{2}}} \\right)\\), which is in normal direction to the fracture plane, and \\(\\varepsilon_{s}\\) is the minimum principal strain, \\({\\varepsilon_{s}} = \\min \\left( {{\\varepsilon_{1}},{\\varepsilon_{2}}} \\right)\\), which in the direction parallel to the fracture plane (i.e., smeared band of micro-cracks).\nIt is important to note that in Equation 14.30 constitutive matrix \\(\\left[ \\mathbf{C}_{ns} \\right]\\) is defined in the local axis system (\\(n-s\\) direction in Figure 14.2 c. However, in a finite element computation this matrix is transformed to the global \\(x-y\\) coordinate directions, \\(\\left[ {{{\\mathbf{C}}_{global}}} \\right]\\), by using\n\\[\n\\left[ {{{\\mathbf{C}}_{global}}} \\right] = {\\left[ {\\mathbf{R}} \\right]^T}\\left[ {{{\\mathbf{C}}_{ns}}} \\right]\\left[ {\\mathbf{R}} \\right]\n\\tag{14.31}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\n\\left[ {\\mathbf{R}} \\right] = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{cc}\n  {{{\\cos }^2}\\theta }&{{{\\sin }^2}\\theta }&{\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta } \\\\\n  {{{\\sin }^2}\\theta }&{{{\\cos }^2}\\theta }&{ - \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta } \\\\\n  { - 2\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta }&{2\\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta }&{{{\\cos }^2}\\theta  - {{\\sin }^2}\\theta }\n\\end{array}} \\right]\n\\tag{14.32}\\]\nin which \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the \\(n\\)-axis and \\(x\\)-axis as shown in Figure 14.2 c. With increasing strain softening, the damaged elastic modulus \\(E_{n}\\) (see Figure 14.2 d), and therefore the parameters \\(\\eta\\) and \\(\\mu\\) decrease gradually and may eventually reach zero values after complete fracture (\\(\\varepsilon_{n}&gt;\\varepsilon_{cr}\\)). The damaged state constitutive matrix given in Equation 14.30 is updated as the parameters \\(\\eta\\) and \\(\\mu\\) change their values, and these changes are also reflected in the global constitutive matrix (see Equation 14.31). In addition, the change in global constitutive matrix \\(\\left[ \\mathbf{C}_{global} \\right]\\) is also caused by a rotation of the local axis system, which is always kept aligned with the directions of principal strains to keep the principal stresses and strains coaxial. The CRCM is very effective in alleviating the stress locking which is usually observed in fixed crack models (Rots 1991).\n\n\n14.3.5 Closing and reopening of cracks\nDuring the unloading/reloading, when the strain, \\(\\varepsilon_{n}\\), is less than the previously attained maximum value, \\(\\varepsilon_{max}\\) (see Figure 14.2 d), the secant modulus, \\(E_{n}\\) and therefore \\(\\eta\\), do not change; however, the parameter \\(\\mu\\) changes during this process. During unloading the shear reduction factor, \\(\\mu\\), gradually increases with the reduction of \\(\\varepsilon_{n}\\). The damaged state elastic modulus in the normal direction, \\(E_{n}\\) (which may have reached a zero value), is replaced by the undamaged initial value, \\(E_{0}\\), if the parameter \\(\\mu\\) is greater than a threshold value \\(\\mu_{c}\\). In this study \\(\\mu_{c}=0.95\\) is considered. In subsequent loading steps, when \\(\\varepsilon_{n}&gt;0\\), the value \\(\\mu\\) is determined by using the damaged value \\(\\eta\\) to determine the reopening of cracks. If \\(\\mu\\) becomes less than \\(\\mu_{c}\\), the element behavior is determined by either reloading or the reopening path depending on the final state attained in previous tensile cycles. The appropriate value of the damage modulus, \\(E_{n}\\), is reused in Equation 14.30 at that state.\nIn what follows an informal explanation regarding the the physical significance of CRCM during the unloading/reloading process is presented. Imagine the smeared band of micro-cracks developed inside the test-specimen subjected to dynamic loading. In addition, assume that the material is partially damaged (this state is described by point-A in Figure 14.2 d). At this stage, strength of the material has degraded in both normal and tangential directions to the plane. In CRCM this corresponds to the \\(\\eta&lt;1.0\\) and \\(\\mu&lt;1.0\\), where the former and later are related to the strength reduction in normal and tangential directions, respectively. At this stage, if loading continues then \\(\\eta\\) and \\(\\mu\\) will keep decreasing denoting the strength reduction in smeared band due to growth of cracks. In case of unloading, the normal strain \\(\\varepsilon_{n}\\) decreases and cracks start closing, accordingly the shear resistance factor, \\(\\mu\\), starts to increase compare to its value at point-A in Figure 14.2 d. This signifies the gain of strength in tangential direction to the damaged plane due to the partial closing of cracks. During unloading, as long as the cracks are still opened (i.e. \\(\\mu&lt;\\mu_{c}\\)), the strength in the normal direction remains same as that of point-A. In CRCM, this behavior is simulated by keeping\n\\(E_{n}\\) and \\(\\eta\\) fixed to their values at point point-A as long as the condition \\(\\mu&lt;\\mu_{c}\\) is satisfied. The condition \\(\\mu \\ge \\mu_{c}\\) depicts the state of fully closed cracks. In this situation material regains its undamaged initial compressible strength. In addition to \\(\\mu \\ge \\mu_{c}\\), one should also check the value of \\(\\eta\\) since \\(\\eta&lt;1\\) and \\(eta=1\\) refer to the damaged and undamaged state, respectively. During reloading, partially or fully closed cracks reopen, and the condition \\(\\mu &lt; \\mu_{c}\\) is satisfied. The element behavior is determined by either reloading or the reopening path depending on the final state attained in previous tensile cycles. The appropriate values, \\(\\eta\\), \\(\\mu\\), and \\(E_{n}\\) should be used in Equation 14.30 to compute the constitutive matrix.\n\n\n\n\nBažant, Zdeněk P. 1987. “Snapback Instability at Crack Ligament Tearing and Its Implication for Fracture Micromechanics.” Cement and Concrete Research 17 (6): 951–67.\n\n\nBhattacharjee, SS, and P Leger. 1993. “Seismic Cracking and Energy Dissipation in Concrete Gravity Dams.” Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics 22 (11): 991–1007.\n\n\nBrühwiler, E. 1990. “Fracture of Mass Concreete Under Simulated Seismic Action.” Dam Engineering 1 (EPFL-ARTICLE-181083): 153–76.\n\n\nCalayir, Yusuf, and Muhammet Karaton. 2005. “Seismic Fracture Analysis of Concrete Gravity Dams Including Dam–Reservoir Interaction.” Computers & Structures 83 (19-20): 1595–1606.\n\n\nCervera, Miguel, Javier Oliver, and Rui Faria. 1995. “Seismic Evaluation of Concrete Dams via Continuum Damage Models.” Earthquake Engineering & Structural Dynamics 24 (9): 1225–45.\n\n\nFenves, G., and A.

    "text": "15.1 Summary\nThe chapter presents space-time finite element formulations for the problems involving dynamic response of solids and structures with nonlinear stress-strain relationships. The problem of dynamic interaction between the concrete gravity dam and reservoir is taken as a model problem, in which a generalized nonlinear stress-strain relationship is used to describe the material behavior of concrete in the dam. The foundation underneath the dam-reservoir (DR) system is assumed to be perfectly rigid. The governing equations describing the dynamic interaction between dam and reservoir constitute a system of linear-nonlinear coupled equations, in which linear equations govern the reservoir domain and nonlinear equations govern the solid domain. Subsequently, v-ST/FEM weak form is derived and then discretized by using the space-time finite elements. Accordingly, an unsymmetrical system of linear-nonlinear algebraic equations describes the discrete form of the v-ST/FEM weak form. A block-iterative scheme is devised to enforce the coupling between the solid and fluid domain. In each iteration of v-ST/FEM with the block-iterative scheme, the linearized equations of the solid domain are first solved to compute the increments in the velocity field. Subsequently, the total velocities are corrected and then used for computing the trial values of hydrodynamic pressures in the reservoir by solving the linear equation for the reservoir domain. Iterations are performed until the convergence in the solutions is achieved. In each iteration of the proposed scheme, therefore, linear equations for the solid and fluid domain are solved, separately, which significantly decreases the computation cost.\nIn the present problem, nonlinearity is caused by only the presence of stress term in the v-ST/FEM weak form. Accordingly, two v-ST/FEM schemes are proposed for the time integration of the space-time nodal vectors and matrices comprising the stress term. The first scheme uses the three-point Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rule for time-integration, whereas the second scheme uses the two-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature rule. Further, the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rules include the endpoints of the time interval, while the latter approach includes the points only located inside the time interval.\nSubsequently, to evaluate the numerical performance of the v-ST/FEM schemes dynamic fracture analyses of the concrete dam are performed. Numerical simulations are performed for following two cases: the first case ignores the coupling between the dam and reservoir, and the second case includes the coupling between dam and reservoir. In the former case, hydrodynamic pressures are set to zero in the discretized equations of the solid domain, consequently, block-iterative scheme reduces to the Newton method.\nA co-axially rotating crack model (CRCM) with exponential strain softening rule is employed to model the fracture of the concrete. Finite element implementation of the CRCM requires the average of integration point strains to determine the cracking behavior of the element as a whole. In v-ST/FEM, one can opt the average of either spatial integration point strains or the space-time integration point strains. Accordingly, three v-ST/FEM schemes are devised for the dynamic fracture analysis of the concrete dam: v-ST/FEM-1 corresponds to the three-point Gauss-Lobatto rule and the spatially averaged strains, v-ST/FEM-2 corresponds to the two-point Gauss-Legendre rule and the spatially averaged strains, and v-ST/FEM-3 corresponds to the two-point Gauss-Legendre rule and the space-time averaged strains.\nNumerical simulations presented in this chapter confirms that all v-ST/FEM schemes are consistent with each other. All schemes can successfully simulate the crack propagation in the concrete dam during the earthquake loading. Dynamic fracture analysis of concrete dam involves the rapid change of the stiffness of the dam due to the crack opening-closing-reopening cycles. The results indicates that v-ST/FEM-1 is the most robust algorithm among the three v-ST/FEM schemes discussed here. Further, total number of iteration increases at the instant of crack closing and smaller time steps may be required to achieve the convergence. During the crack opening and reopening, however, number of iterations are relatively low which can be attributed to the high order accuracy of the v-ST/FEM schemes.",

    "text": "15.4 Implementation of v-ST/FEM formulation\nThe finite element discretized equations for fluid domain, Equation 15.23, and solid domain, Equation 15.24, constructs a system of coupled equations. The coupling between dam (solid-domain) and reservoir (fluid-domain) takes place through the soil-dam interface \\(\\Gamma^{s}_{fd}\\); the motion of the dam influences the hydrodynamic pressure in the reservoir which in turn modifies the response of dam. In addition, the nature of interfacial coupling between the dam and reservoir is linear; Equation 15.23 (for fluid domain) is linear in both \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), and Equation 15.24 is linear in \\(q\\).\nFurther, Equation 15.23 and Equation 15.24 individually constitute a system of linear and nonlinear algebraic equations, respectively. Moreover, the nonlinearity of Equation 15.24, and the system of coupled equations, only comes from the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of the dam. The space-time nodal vector \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{J}}_\\sigma ^s} \\right\\}\\) in Equation 15.24 is the one which contains the stress term, and finite element expression for this term is given by 1\n\\[\n\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{J}}_\\sigma ^s} \\right\\}: = \\left\\{ {J_\\sigma ^s} \\right\\}_i^a\\left( I \\right) = \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {{T_a}\\left( {\\int_{\\Omega _h^s}^{} {\\frac{{\\partial {N^I}}}{{\\partial {x_j}}}{\\sigma _{ij}}d\\Omega } } \\right)dt}\n\\tag{15.25}\\]\nIn Equation 15.25, the term enclosed inside the parentheses denotes the spatial-nodal value of the internal force vector \\(\\mathbf{f_{int}}\\), which is often used in the semi-discrete finite element analysis. For the sake of clarity, let us recast \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{J}}_\\sigma ^s} \\right\\}\\) in terms of internal force vector \\(\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{f}}_{\\operatorname{int} }}} \\right\\}\\) as,\n\\[\n\\left\\{ {J_\\sigma ^s} \\right\\}_i^a\\left( I \\right) = \\int_{{I_n}}^{} {{T_a}f_{\\operatorname{int} }^{}\\left( {i,I} \\right)dt}\n\\tag{15.26}\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nf_{\\operatorname{int} }\\left( i, I \\right) = \\int_{\\Omega _h^s}^{} {\\frac{{\\partial {N^I}}}{{\\partial {x_j}}}{\\sigma _{ij}}d\\Omega }\n\\tag{15.27}\\]\ndenotes the nodal value of \\(i^{th}\\) spatial component of the internal force vector at time \\(t\\in I_{n}\\).\nIn a finite element computer program, integration over the spatial domain of a finite element is computed by using the Gaussian quadrature rules. [^2] Similarly, the integration in time domain given in Equation 15.26 can be performed by using the Gaussian quadrature rules. In former case, the choice of a particular quadrature rule for numerical integration depends upon the topology of the spatial finite element.\nIn the context of numerical integration in time domain one can notice that the topological structure of a time finite element is essentially same as the topological structure of the one-dimensional spatial finite element. Therefore, by using a finite set of quadrature points, \\(\\left\\{ {{\\theta ^1}, \\cdots ,{\\theta ^{{n_{ipt}}}}} \\right\\}\\), and corresponding weights, \\(\\left\\{ {w_t^1, \\cdots ,{w_t}^{{n_{ipt}}}} \\right\\}\\), for numerical integration of Equation 15.26,\n\\[\n\\left\\{ {J_\\sigma ^s} \\right\\}_i^a\\left( I \\right) \\approx \\frac{{\\Delta {t_n}}}{2}\\sum\\limits_{\\alpha  = 1}^{{n_{ipt}}} {T_a^\\alpha f_{\\operatorname{int} }^\\alpha \\left( {i,I} \\right)w_t^\\alpha }\n\\tag{15.28}\\]\nwhere \\(n_{ipt}\\) is the total number of integration points, \\(T_{a}^{\\alpha}\\) for \\(a=1,2\\) are obtained by using \\(\\theta^{\\alpha}\\) in Equation 15.14, and \\(f^{\\alpha}_{int}(i,I)\\) is given by\n\\[\nf_{\\operatorname{int} }^\\alpha \\left( {i,I} \\right) = \\int_{\\Omega _h^s}^{} {\\frac{{\\partial {N^I}}}{{\\partial {x_j}}}\\sigma _{ij}^\\alpha d\\Omega }\n\\tag{15.29}\\]\nin which \\(\\sigma _{ij}^\\alpha:=\\sigma \\left( {{\\mathbf{x}},{\\theta ^\\alpha }} \\right)\\) is the stress at any spatial point \\(\\mathbf{x}\\in \\Omega^{s}_{h}\\) and time \\(t^{\\alpha}=t(\\theta^{\\alpha}) \\in I_{n}\\) (cf.

Table 15.3 presents some low-order Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rules for computing the integration over the interval \\(\\left[ { - 1,1} \\right]\\). It is worthwhile to mention that most of the finite element programs demand information of the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules to perform integration over the spatial domain of a line element, a quadrangle, brick element, among others. From the view point of Equation 15.28, Gauss-Legendre rules, however, appear to be inconvenient since the end points of the domain \\(\\left[ { - 1,1} \\right]\\) are not included in the Gauss-Legendre quadrature points. Therefore, stresses already computed at time \\(t=t_{n}\\) cannot be used in Equation 15.28, moreover, additional computations must be performed in case information about the stress at time \\(t=t_{n+1}\\) is required. The Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rules, on the other hand, always comprise the end points of the domain \\(\\left[ { - 1,1} \\right]\\). It should also be note that \\(n\\) Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points are only accurate for polynomials up to degree \\(2n-3\\), whereas \\(n\\) number of Gauss-Legendre quadrature points yields an exact result for polynomial of degree \\(2n-1\\) or less.\nLet us now focus on the total number of temporal quadrature points required in Equation 15.28. The linear interpolation of velocity in time (see Equation 15.16) makes the displacement and strain quadratic in time (see Equation 15.17 and Equation 14.9). In accordance with Equation 14.8, Equation 14.10, Equation 15.16, it is safe to assume a quadratic variation of the stress in time interval \\(I_{n}\\) which will make the integrand in Equation 15.26 third order in time. Therefore, it is sufficient to use the two-point Gauss-Legendre rule or the three-point Gauss-Lobatto rule in Equation 15.28 (see Table 15.3).\nThe two-point Gauss-Legendre form of Equation 15.28 can be obtained by using the quadratures points \\(\\left\\{ { - \\frac{1}{{\\sqrt 3 }},\\frac{1}{{\\sqrt 3 }}} \\right\\}\\), and the corresponding weights \\(\\left\\{ {1,1} \\right\\}\\). The results are presented below.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\left\\{ {J_\\sigma ^s} \\right\\}_i^{a = 1}\\left( I \\right) = \\frac{{\\Delta {t_n}}}{2}\\left\\{ {0.211f_{\\operatorname{int} }^1\\left( {i,I} \\right) + 0.789f_{\\operatorname{int} }^2\\left( {i,I} \\right)} \\right\\}\n\\\\\n\\left\\{ {J_\\sigma ^s} \\right\\}_i^{a = 2}\\left( I \\right) = \\frac{{\\Delta {t_n}}}{2}\\left\\{ {0.789f_{\\operatorname{int} }^1\\left( {i,I} \\right) + 0.211f_{\\operatorname{int} }^2\\left( {i,I} \\right)} \\right\\}\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{15.31}\\]\nwhere \\({f_{\\operatorname{int} }^1\\left( {i,I} \\right)}\\) and \\({f_{\\operatorname{int} }^2\\left( {i,I} \\right)}\\) correspond to the stress evaluated at time \\({t_1} = 0.211{t_n} + 0.789{t_{n + 1}}\\) and \\({t_2} = 0.789{t_n} + 0.211{t_{n + 1}}\\), respectively.\nThe three-point Gauss-Lobatto form of Equation 15.28 is obtained by using the quadratures points \\(\\left\\{ { - 1,0,1} \\right\\}\\), and the corresponding weights \\(\\left\\{ {\\frac{1}{3},\\frac{4}{3},\\frac{1}{3}} \\right\\}\\).

The strains in solid domain are also computed using the updated values of displacement field which are subsequently used for calculating the stress and material tangent tensor \\(C_{ijkl}\\) from the stress-strain relationship. The stresses and material tangent modulus are then used for computing the residual vector (see Equation 15.42) and the space-time tangent matrix in Equation 15.46 and Equation 15.48. Finally, the convergence in solutions is checked by computing the Euclidian norm of residual vector \\(\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{R}}^s}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}}} \\right\\|\\) and incremental-velocity vector \\(\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {\\Delta {\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}}} \\right\\|\\) and using the following convergence criterion.\n\\[\n\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{R}}^s}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}}} \\right\\| \\leqslant {\\epsilon_R}\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{R}}^s}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( 0 \\right)}}} \\right\\|\n\\tag{15.51}\\]\n\\[\n\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {\\Delta {\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( k \\right)}}} \\right\\| \\leqslant {\\epsilon_v}\\left\\| {{{\\left\\{ {\\Delta {\\mathbf{\\tilde v}}} \\right\\}}^{\\left( 0 \\right)}}} \\right\\|\n\\tag{15.52}\\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{R}\\) and \\(\\epsilon_{v}\\) are the tolerance for convergence in residual vector and velocity field, respectively. The iterations are stopped in case Equation 15.51 and/or Equation 15.52 are satisfied by the trial solutions.\nIn Equation 15.45 and Equation 15.50 the space-time nodal vectors \\(\\left\\{ {{{\\mathbf{J}}^f}} \\right\\}\\) and \\(\\left\\{ {{\\mathbf{J}}_{fixed}^s} \\right\\}\\), and the space-time matrices \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{fixed}^s} \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{H}}_{fd}^s} \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{H}}_{fd}^f} \\right]\\), and \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^f} \\right]\\) remain fixed during the iteration in a given time step. Accordingly, these space-time vectors and matrices only need to be computed once in the beginning of the iteration in a given time step. In this context, if a uniform time-step size \\(\\Delta{t}_{n}=\\Delta{t},\\forall n=0,\\cdots, N-1\\) is employed then the aforementioned space-time matrices need to be computed only once for all the time. Furthermore, the space-time tangent matrix \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^s} \\right]\\) in Equation 15.45 and \\(\\left[ {{\\mathbf{K}}_{st}^f} \\right]\\) in Equation 15.50 yield unsymmetrical system of linear equations. These linear equations can be solved by using GpBiCG algorithm (Zhang 1997). The algorithm should be implemented in an element by element manner for avoiding the assembly of global space-time tangent matrix. Lastly, the complete procedure to solve Equation 15.45 and Equation 15.50 with the block-iterative scheme as discussed in this section is summarized in Algorithm [algo:ch7-algo-1].\nThe presentation of v-ST/FEM formulation and its implementation procedure made so far is applicable to a wide class of nonlinear material behavior such as elasto-plasticity, elasto-visco-plasticity, damage-model, nonlinear cyclic models for soils, among others. Moreover, if the hydrodynamic pressure related terms are ignored in governing equations of the solid domain (both partial differential equations and space-time finite element discretization), then the present model-problem transforms into a problem of analyzing the dynamic response of solids with nonlinear stress-strain relationship to the transient loading. To demonstrated the performance of v-ST/FEM the Coaxially-Rotating-Crack-Model (CRCM) will be used to model the concrete material in the dam since the major nonlinearities of typical concrete structures are often caused by cracking. The theoretical and computational aspects of the CRCM model are discussed in the next section.",

    "text": "15.7 Dynamic response of the nonlinear dam without hydrodynamic effects\nKoyna concrete gravity dam, which is extensively analyzed in several previous studies (Bhattacharjee and Leger 1993; Calayir and Karaton 2005b, 2005a; Cervera, Oliver, and Faria 1995; Omidi, Valliappan, and Lotfi 2013; Ghrib and Tinawi 1995), is selected for numerical application. This dam is one of the few concrete dams that have experienced a destructive earthquake. The earthquake of December 11, 1967, with maximum and minimum acceleration around 0.5g, caused significant structural damage of the dam, including horizontal cracks on the upstream and down streams faces of a number of number of non-overflow monoliths around the elevation at which the slope of downstream face changes abruptly.\nIn this section, the nonlinear dynamic fracture analysis of Koyna concrete gravity dam which is subjected to both horizontal and vertical components of earthquake motion is performed. The physical dimensions and finite element mesh of the tallest section of the dam are illustrated in Fig. 3. The dam is \\(103\\) m tall and \\(70\\) m wide at the base. The height of water in the reservoir is taken to be \\(90.5\\) m and the upstream face of the dam is assumed to be straight and vertical. The dam is subjected to the self-weight and hydrostatic pressure loads to determine the pre-seismic state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Physical dimensions and finite element mesh of the Koyna dam.\n\n\n\nFurther, the concrete material in the dam is modeled by using the co-axially rotating crack model (CRCM) which is described in the previous section. The material parameters for the concrete dam are selected as follows: The elastic modulus (\\(E\\)) is \\(31027\\) MPa, the Poisson’s ratio (\\(\\nu\\)) is \\(0.2\\), the mass density (\\(\\rho\\)) is \\(2643\\) Kg/m\\({}^{3}\\), the ultimate tensile strength (\\(\\sigma_{t}\\)) is \\(1.5\\) MPa and the fracture energy (\\(G_{f}\\)) is \\(150\\) N/m. Dynamic loading affects the concrete material parameters. Elastic modulus of concrete is generally considered to be less sensitive to strain rate than the tensile strength and fracture energy (Bhattacharjee and Leger 1993). Due to strain rate effects, the tensile strength and the fracture energy are increased by \\(20\\%\\) approximately, leading to the values of \\(1.8\\) MPa and \\(180\\) N/m. Further, damping in the concrete dam is modeled by Rayleigh damping with critical damping ratio of \\(5\\%\\) in the fundamental vibration mode of the dam alone with no cracking. The resultant values of damping coefficients are \\(\\alpha=0.0026\\) and \\(\\beta=0.9676\\).\nNumerical simulations are carried out for the horizontal and vertical components of the Koyna accelerogram (Figure 14.2) without considering the hydrodynamic interactions between the dam and reservoir. A uniform time step size \\(\\Delta t=0.01\\) s is adopted for time integration, and the resultant unsymmetrical system of linear equations is solved by using the GpBiCG algorithm with tolerance value of \\(1.0\\times10^{-6}\\). In this section, dynamic response of the dam is computed by using following three different v-ST/FEM schemes:\n\nv-ST/FEM-1, which represents the v-ST/FEM with a three-point Gauss-Lobatto integration rule for computing Equation 15.25 and Equation 15.28 (see also Equation 15.32). In finite element implementation of CRCM, average of spatial-integration point strains is taken as representative of the behavior of the spatial-element as a whole.\nv-ST/FEM-2, which represents the v-ST/FEM with a two-point Gauss-Legendre integration rule for computing Equation 15.25 and Equation 15.28 (see also Equation 15.31). In finite element implementation of CRCM, average of spatial-integration point strains is taken as representative of the behavior of the spatial-element as a whole.\nv-ST/FEM-3, which represents the v-ST/FEM with a two-point Gauss-Legendre integration rule for computing Equation 15.25 and Equation 15.28 (see also Equation 15.31).

    "text": "15.8 Results for v-ST/FEM-1 scheme\nThis section examines the cracking effects of the concrete material on the seismic response of the concrete dam. In linear analysis isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic stress-strain relationship is used for the concrete whereas for nonlinear analysis material behavior is modeled by CRCM. v-ST/FEM-1 with tolerance in residual and velocity set to \\(1.0\\times10^{-3}\\) (see Equation 15.51 and Equation 15.52) is employed to compute the nonlinear response of the Koyna dam.\nFigure 15.4 and Figure 15.6 show the time history graphs of the horizontal and vertical components of the displacement, velocity, and acceleration at node-9 2 and node-5 3 of the dam, respectively. Due to the infinite rigidity of the foundation, a stress concentration induces a crack at the base of the dam. At time \\(t=1.89\\) sec, the heel of the dam (element-1 in Figure 15.1) softens completely (i.e., \\(\\eta \\approx 0\\)) which corresponds to the case of complete fracture of that element, subsequently, the crack propagates horizontally in the downstream direction along the base of the dam. The cracks at the base of the dam then extend to an approximate distance of \\(13\\) m from the heel of the dam. During the upstream movement of the dam around \\(t=2.94\\) sec element-2080 in the dam starts softening. The crack, however, does not propagate instantaneously since more elements at the base of the dam continue softening. The spatial distribution of CRCM parameter \\(\\eta\\), which indicates the strength reduction of the material in the direction normal to the fractured plane, at time \\(t=2.73\\) sec is depicted in Figure 15.9 and the corresponding deformed configuration of the dam is plotted in Figure 15.10.\nDuring the upstream movement of the dam, around time \\(t=3.91\\) sec, a fully opened crack appears in the element-2080 which subsequently propagates in the horizontal direction towards the downstream face of the dam. This process forms a localized band of cracked elements in the neck-area of the dam which can be seen from the deformed configuration of the dam given in Figure 15.10 b. Figure 15.9 b depicts the spatial distribution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta\\), at time \\(t=3.91\\) sec, where it is noteworthy that due to the upstream movement of the dam cracks at the base are closed. The continued upstream movement of the dam causes the cracks in the neck-area of the dam to propagate in the downward direction towards the upstream face of the dam (see Figure 15.9 c and Figure 15.10 c). Subsequently, the downstream movement of the dam causes new cracks at the base and the upstream face of the dam. In addition during this time, the band of cracks near the element-2080 starts to close. Accordingly, the elements in this regime momentarily gain their original compressive strength (see Figure 15.8). Spatial distribution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta\\), and deformed configuration of the dam at time \\(t=4.15\\) sec are presented in Figure 15.9 d and Figure 15.10 d depict, respectively.\nThe maximum displacement at node-9 of the dam in the upstream direction occurs at time \\(t=4.35\\) sec as depicted in Figure 15.4 . At this instant, the spatial distribution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta\\), and the corresponding deformed configuration of the dam are illustrated in Figure 15.9 e and Figure 15.10 e, respectively. The maximum horizontal and vertical displacement of the node-9, which occurs at time \\(t=4.55\\) sec as depicted in Figure 15.4, corresponds to the situation where element-726 at the upstream face of the dam undergoes a complete strain-softening. This is confirmed by the deformed configuration of the dam at time \\(t=4.55\\) given in Figure 15.10 f. The spatial distribution of the parameter \\(\\eta\\), which is given in Figure 15.9 f, shows the localization of a crack band meeting the downstream crack profile in the dam interior. At this time, the cracks near the downstream face close as the dam swings towards the downstream direction. Accordingly, the maximum compressive principal stresses inside the element-2080 of the dam achieve a peak value of \\(9\\) MPa around this time (see Figure 15.8). At this instant the entire neck of the dam is damaged, and the subsequent motion of the cracked dam is dominated by rigid-body rocking of the upper portion of the dam.\nFrom the time-history graphs of displacement, velocity and acceleration plotted in Figure 15.4 (at node-9) and Figure 15.6 (at node-5) it is evident that the vibration period of the dam increases due to crack propagation in the dam. This effect is clearly visible in the corresponding Fourier spectrums presented in Figure 15.5 and Figure 15.7, where the cracking in concrete dam shifts the spectrum towards the lower frequency regime.\nThe time history graphs of the maximum tensile and compressive principal stresses occurred in the element-1, element-726, and element-2080 are plotted in Figure 15.8. 4 The maximum tensile principal stresses for the linear case take larger peak values while the maximum peak values of those for the nonlinear case are about the tensile strength of the concrete. In Figure 15.8 it is visible that the tensile strength of an element is completely removed after the cracking. The maximum compressive principal stresses for linear case also generally take larger peak values than those for nonlinear case. However, in situations where a crack closes completely (i.e., \\(\\mu \\ge 0.95\\)), peak values of the maximum compressive principal stresses in nonlinear case are slightly more than the peak values of those for the linear case (see Figure 15.8). Lastly, the evolution of CRCM parameter \\(\\eta\\) in selected elements of the Koyna dam is depicted in Figure 15.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: Evolution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta=E_{n}/E_{0}\\), for some elements of the Koyna dam obtained by using the v-ST/FEM-1 without considering the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: Time history graphs of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at the crest of the Koyna dam (node-9) computed by using v-ST/FEM-1 without considering the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.5: Fourier spectrum of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at the crest of the Koyna dam (node-9) computed by using v-ST/FEM-1 without considering the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.6: Time history graphs of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at node-9 of the Koyna dam computed by using v-ST/FEM-1 without considering the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.7: Fourier spectrum of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at node-9 of the Koyna dam computed by using v-ST/FEM-1 without considering the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.8: Time history graphs of the maximum tensile principal stresses, \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) on the left hand side, and maximum compressive principal stresses, \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) on the right hand side, inside the selected elements of the Koyna dam computed by using v-ST/FEM-1 without considering the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.9: Spatial distribution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta=E_{n}/E_{0}\\) in Koyna dam at selected times computed by using the v-ST/FEM-1 without considering the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.10: Amplified deformed configuration of the Koyna dam at selected times computed by using the v-ST/FEM-1 without considering the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.",

The physical dimensions, finite element mesh and the material properties of the concrete dam are identical to the those presented in the previous section. The height of water in the reservoir, \\(H_{f}\\), is assumed to be constant at a value of \\(90.5\\) m. Reservoir domain is truncated by placing a viscous boundary at a distance of \\(412\\) m, which is four times the height of the concrete dam, from the dam in the upstream direction. Figure 15.21 depicts the finite element mesh of the reservoir used for the numerical simulations. The speed of acoustic wave in water is \\(1439\\) m/s, and the mass density of the water is \\(1000\\) kg/m\\({}^{3}\\).

Numerical simulations are carried out for the horizontal and vertical components of the Koyna accelerograms plotted in Figure 15.2. The dam-reservoir interactions are modeled by solving the system of coupled equations using the v-ST/FEM and the block-iterative scheme presented in this chapter.

    "text": "15.12 Results for v-ST/FEM-1 scheme (including hydrodynamic effects)\nThis section examines the cracking effects of the concrete material on the seismic response of the concrete dam. In linear analysis isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic stress-strain relationship is used for the concrete whereas for nonlinear analysis material behavior is modeled by CRCM. v-ST/FEM-1 with tolerance in residual and velocity set to \\(1.0\\times10^{-3}\\) (see Equation 15.51 and Equation 15.52) is employed to compute the nonlinear response of the Koyna dam.\nFigure 15.23 and Figure 15.25 show the time history graphs of the horizontal and vertical components of the displacement, velocity, and acceleration at node-9 and node-5 of the dam, respectively. Around time \\(t=1.82\\) sec, element-1 near the heel of the dam (see Figure 15.1) softens completely (i.e., \\(\\eta \\approx 0\\)). Due to the infinite rigidity of the foundation during the downstream motion of the dam, the cracks propagate in the downstream direction along the base of the dam. At time \\(t=2.30\\) sec the cracks at the base of the dam extend to an approximate distance of \\(17\\) m from the heel of the dam.\nDuring the upstream movement of the dam, around time \\(t=2.46\\) sec, significant strain softening occurs (i.e., \\(\\eta \\approx 0\\)) in element-1404 located near the discontinuity in the slope of the downstream face (see Figure 15.22). The crack quickly propagates in the horizontal direction towards the downstream face of the dam. Thus a localized band of cracked elements forms in the neck-area of the dam. Both the deformed configuration of the dam given in Figure 15.29 a and the spatial distribution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta\\), given in Figure 15.28 a confirms this. In the later figure, it is noteworthy that due to the upstream movement of the dam cracks at the base are closed. Subsequently, the downstream movement of the dam causes severe cracks at the upstream face.\nAt time \\(t=2.70\\) sec the crack profile and the corresponding deformed configuration of the dam are given in Figure 15.28 b and Figure 15.29 b, respectively. During this time, the cracks near the vicinity of element-1404 start closing. Therefore, elements in this regime momentarily gain their original compressible strength (see Figure 15.27). The maximum displacement at node-9 of the dam in the upstream direction occurs at time \\(t=4.00\\) sec as shown in Figure 15.23. Consequently, during this time, vertical displacement at node-5 of the dam achieves a peak value (see Figure 15.25) which corresponds to the maximum opening state of the crack at the downstream face. At this instant, the spatial distribution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta\\), and the corresponding deformed configuration of the dam are illustrated in Figure 15.28 d and Figure 15.9 d, respectively.\nNote that the cracks at the upstream face are in the closed state due to the upstream motion of the dam. However, these closed cracks open again when the dam swings back in the downstream direction leading to a maximum displacement of the node-9 in both horizontal and vertical directions (see Figure 15.23). The spatial distribution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta\\), and the corresponding deformed configuration of the dam at time \\(t=4.17\\) are given in Figure 15.28 e and Figure 15.29 e, respectively. The cracks at the downstream face are in the closed state due to the downstream motion of the dam. Accordingly, the maximum compressive principal stress inside the element-1404 of the dam achieve a peak value of \\(10\\) MPa around this time (see Figure 15.27).\nAt this instant the entire neck of the dam is damaged, and the subsequent motion of the cracked dam is dominated by rigid-body rocking of the upper portion of the dam. From the time-history graphs of displacement, velocity and acceleration plotted in Figure 15.23 (at node-9) and Figure 15.25 (at node-5) it is evident that the vibration period of the dam increases due to crack propagation in the dam. This effect is clearly visible in the corresponding Fourier spectrums presented in Figure 15.24 and Figure 15.26, where the cracking in concrete dam shifts the spectrum towards the lower frequency regime. The time history graphs of the maximum tensile and compressive principal stresses occurred in the element-1 and element-1404 are plotted in Figure 15.27.5\nThe maximum tensile principal stresses for the linear case take larger peak values while the maximum peak values of those for the nonlinear case are about the tensile strength of the concrete. In Figure 15.27 it is visible that the tensile strength of an element is completely removed after the cracking. The maximum compressive principal stresses for linear case also generally take larger peak values than those for nonlinear case. However, in situations where a crack closes completely (i.e., \\(\\mu \\ge 0.95\\)), peak values of the maximum compressive principal stresses in nonlinear case are slightly more than the peak values of those for the linear case (see Figure 15.27). Lastly, the evolution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta\\), in selected elements of the Koyna dam is depicted in Figure 15.22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.22: Evolution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta=E_{n}/E_{0}\\), for some elements of the Koyna dam obtained by using the v-ST/FEM-1 including the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.23: Time history graphs of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at node-9 of the Koyna dam computed by using the v-ST/FEM-1 including the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.24: Fourier spectrum of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at node-9 of the Koyna dam computed by using the v-ST/FEM-1 including the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.25: Time history graphs of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at node-5 of the Koyna dam computed by using v-ST/FEM-1 including the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.26: Fourier spectrum of the displacement, velocity and acceleration at node-5 of the Koyna dam computed by using v-ST/FEM-1 including the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.27: Time history graphs of the maximum tensile principal stresses, \\(\\sigma_{1}\\) on the left hand side, and maximum compressive principal stresses, \\(\\sigma_{2}\\) on the right hand side, inside the selected elements of the Koyna-dam computed by using the v-ST/FEM-1 including the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.28: Spatial distribution of the CRCM parameter, \\(\\eta\\), in the Koyna dam at selected times computed by using the v-ST/FEM-1 including the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.29: Amplified deformed configuration of the Koyna dam at selected times computed by using the v-ST/FEM-1 including the hydrodynamic effects of the reservoir.",
